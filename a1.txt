It adds some great insight by several of the world's best known nature photographers.  Any book that has instructional information from John Shaw, Arthur Morris, Charles Glatzer, and Joe McDonald is well worth the investment. <br /> <br />One of the most difficult aspects of PhotoShop for me has been the effective use of curves.  Tim and Ellen do a much better job at helping with this complex matter than any other book I have read. <br /> <br />The effective utilization of PhotoShop requires as much of an artistic approach as it does as workflow approach.  Tim and Ellen do a very good job of fully developing a great workflow while introducing their own artistic approach. <br /> <br />No one book can every include all the aspects of PhotoShop that you will every need.  However, \\"Photoshop for Nature Photographers : A Workshop in a Book\\" does a great job of specilizing for nature photographers.  As with any workshop, it does require the student to do some work to get the most out of the class. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to any nature photographer who would like to improve their utilization and knowledge of PhotoShop. <br />	2005-10-14

It looks at the technologies, processes and the products from this tiny little land that are improving the lives of so many people. The authors highlight some of the people responsible for this ingenuity that is benefiting the whole world.<br /><br />For example, at the Weizmann Institute, Dr Michal Schwartz has developed a way of harnessing immune system cells to repair and revive damaged nerve fibres. Other medical breakthroughs include the miniscule camera-in-a-tablet used for internal diagnosis, ultrasound for destroying tumours and Israel's highly effective disaster relief operations.<br /><br />A great help to third world people has been the discovery by scientist Yoel Margalith of the Bti bacterium that kills certain kinds of flies and harmful mosquitoes.  This has already saved millions of livers and is an environment-friendly intervention. Most remarkable is that Margalith is a holocaust survivor, of both the Bergen-Belsen and Teresienstadt camps.<br /><br />In many fields Israel is so far ahead of the pack that other countries have no chance of catching up. One of the most interesting innovations developed in Israel is a project to avoid collisions between aircraft and migratory birds. It involved the study of the flight paths of birds. This work of researcher Yossi Leshem is now also used by the Jordanian and Turkish air-force.<br /><br />Israel has more engineers per capita than any other country on earth and a remarkable number of hi-tech companies. Innovation in the fields of computers and information technology is particularly impressive. This encompasses software, operating systems, storage & retrieval systems, verification and firewall technologies, plus a host of mobile phone applications.<br /><br />Israel's creativity is not restricted to science and technology, as there is also much happening in arts and culture. Despite its small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.<br /><br />The founders of this brave country were aware that Israel had almost no natural resources and that its people therefore had to develop and apply their brainpower. Well, they are succeeding spectacularly. What a pity that Israel has to devote so much of its money and resources to protect itself from its neighbours! If its full genius were given free reign, it would become even more of a blessing to the world.ts small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.

The Aztec empire stretched between the Pacific and the Atlantic costs of Mesoamerica, the Maya kingdom was found in the eastern part of Mesoamerica, and the Inca Empire stretched 4,000 miles along the western coast of South America.  But this book considers the people of these regions to be a mosaic of tribes and nations so that most of the chapters are topical, talking about food and drink, religious life, masks, and such in terms of all of the cultures that apply.  There are a few specific chapters devoted to the Incas and their ancestors and Cities of the Andes, but most toss in everything together.<br /><br />I have to admit, I do not find this approach to work anymore than one about Mediterranean cultures that lumps Spain, Italy and Greece together with the likes of Portugal, Sicily, and Crete thrown in for good measure.  In this volume the Olmecs, Teotihuacans, and Toltecs are thrown in for good measure, but not so that you can have anything close to a clear conception of the specific cultures.  There are some topics where it makes sense to talk about multiple cultures, such as the Human sacrifice by the Incas and Aztecs, but that does not apply to all of these topics.  Consequently, I am tempted to get different colored highlighters and color code the three main cultures throughout the book so it is easier to make the connections.<br /><br />As always, the chief attraction of this Eyewitness Book is that it is filled with photographs of artifacts from museums around the world, from the Archaeological Museum in Lima the National Palace in Mexico City to the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence and the Rietberg Museum in Zurich (a subtle reminder that a lot of New World treasures made their way to Europe).  Most of us will never get to see a Toltec coyote warrior inlaid with mother-of-pearl, the Gateway of the Sun at Tiahuanaco, or a \\"teponaztli\\" (horizontal drum) in person.  \\"The Los Angeles Times Book Review\\" called one of these volumes \\"Like a mini-museum between the covers of a book,\\" which is so on point that DK always puts that quote on the back.

I would say that it is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is very exciting and I enjoyed the mystery that was in the story. This is one of the most adventurous books that I have ever read.  <br /> <br />This book is about a ten year old girl, Isabella Zophie, who finds the Locket of Fire and Water in her great aunt's house and when she puts it on she is transported to another world - Zartarbia. She meets a circus which has lots of great characters including Mr Krock O'Dile who is a crocodile that runs the circus.  Isabella is chased by one of the syndicate, Mistress Sectica.  The Syndicate are a group of villains who are trying to control Zartarbia.  Fighting against the syndicate is the Federation Against Dark Forces (FADF) with agents trained in some of the coolest fighting techniques.   <br /> <br />Zartarbia is a magical world where nothing is as it seems. There is a crazy character called the Thinker who is a complete lunatic and very funny.  The first chapter is a bit confusing but you need to keep reading as it is important for later in the book.  <br /> <br />I think that all genders will like this book. Some parts in this book are very funny. If you are interested in fantasy and adventure, then you will enjoy this book.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone.  <br />	2005-10-14

He then goes into their relationship, how it came to be, and the affect it had on their great works of literature. The books influenced by their time together, Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Grant's Personal Memoirs, are considered to be classics and the best that either of the authors ever produced.  In fact, some think that Huckleberry Finn is the best American novel ever, and that Personal Memoirs (about the Mexican and Civil Wars) is the best American book ever written on military events.   Perry records many conversations Grant and Twain had with each other and with the other folks surrounding them, including families and associates.  It makes you feel like you are there, and gives some personal insight into what these gentlemen were really like. We find that they were both quite remarkable as private figures as well as public figures. The story of their relationship rides to a great extent on the heroic drama of Grant racing to finish his book before dying of cancer, to ensure the financial security of his family.  Perry, at the same time, paints a fascinating sketch of what Twain called the Gilded Age, a time of great industrial progress along with great corruption in the U.S. <br /> <br />It was a thoroughly enjoyable read. <br />	2005-10-14

In my mind, it is his greatest gift yet, but not in the sense that one might think. This will be explained in the closing. I will also preface by saying that I am in no way political. Truth is all that I am interested in. <br />   In Hawkins' previous 3 books, the kinesiological response was portrayed as infallible. His language was very absolute in its tone, giving the technique more credibility than it has ever received. Being so absolute with one's tone was the first obvious clue. When one becomes absolute in their tone, they often put an inordinate amount of faith in something outside themselves and overlook the inherent limitations. This is true for everything from religious absolutism to the mythical cure-all in medicine. The person who uses the absolute tone acts as if your salvation lies with this one particular thing.  <br />   I am a traditional naturopath. I was using kinesiology before Hawkins' books, and I am closely connected to practitioners of kinesiology who've used it in excess of 20 years. An observant and curious practitioner quickly realizes that the intent of both the testee and tester influences response. In some cases, a strong-willed practitioner who thinks he knows the cause of imbalance or dis-ease is affecting testee response and in essence using kinesiology to validate his own opinions and beliefs, albeit unknowingly. He will get the positive response he desires, whereas the practitioner with no vested interest in anything except the truth will get a different response on the same testee.  <br />   It has been difficult for me to bridge the gap between Hawkins' theory/ doctoral thesis on his use of kinesiology and the understanding that most experienced practitioners of kinesiology have. Nearly all experienced practitioners simply don't find the technique to be infallible. Certain criteria must be met for accurate response. Those criteria are training, impartiality, and the sincere and humble desire to put absolute truth above all things. Truth is absolute, but the technique is not. Remaining neutral is an ongoing challenge for the practitioner. <br /> <br />   I am not familiar with the testing methods used for Hawkins' doctoral thesis \\"Quantitative and Qualitative Calibration of the Levels of Consciousness\\". However, for it to withstand any scientific scrutiny, both the tester and testee would have to be without any knowledge on the subject matter. There would also have to be at least 20 different testers for the 3000+ test subjects, with each tester coming up with their own test responses to a given list of questions. Responses would not be compared until all testers have compiled their findings. For his thesis, something along these lines was most likely used.  <br />   Throughout \\"Power vs. Force\\", a healthy skepticism was maintained towards Hawkins putting so much faith in this technique. Part of this was based on an inability to get the same responses he was getting. The information presented in \\"The Eye of the I\\" and \\"I\\" was absolutely astounding, and skepticism was temporarily set aside. Apparently, his intent was pure and sincere enough to allow him to experience absolute truth on spiritual inquiry. Much of this can be attributed to his description of a life-changing experience. He was atheist (or possibly agnostic... don't remember which), hit a major crisis in his life, and finally called out in total humility to be shown the truth of God. I feel his pure intent allowed him to access the truth he did. <br />   However, once Hawkins gained confidence in the technique, he apparently fell into the trap of thinking he could divorce himself from influencing response. The methods used for gleaning the information found in \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" would surely not withstand any scientific scrutiny. The simple fact that the subject matter was familiar to the tester(s) and testee(s) disqualifies it. Asking about the nature of life, death, and other unknown spiritual matters is not the same as asking about one's perceived reality, which one already has strong opinions and emotions about and attachments to. Both testers and testees would have to be completely unfamiliar with the line of inquiry to have any guarantee of neutrality. <br /> <br />   Within 30 seconds of opening \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\", it was clear something wasn't right. Hawkins' 3 previous books have helped us to discern truth from falsehood more clearly. Many of us have reached a place where now we `just know' the truth. It is often a clear gut feeling, and at that point the kinesiological response seems unnecessary. In a way, it turns out the technique was only a tool to guide us to our own inner knowing.  <br />   Hawkins acknowledges the existence of ignorance and untruth, but does not address the issue of deliberate deception. It is ironic that after years of devotion to the truth, Hawkins still does not fully grasp the nature of deception. The world citizenry is currently experiencing one of the most elaborate mass brainwashes in history.  <br />   In fact, Hawkins even engages in deception when he explains the Iraq situation. He indicates that the primary reason to be there is to protect the world's (and specifically America's) economic and oil interests. Yet the primary reason given to the public for going to war was weapons of mass destruction. Whether or not it was a fact that there were actually WMDs misses the point. It was given as the main reason, and it was not. That is deception. For Hawkins to agree with the idea of justifiable deceptions is a clear indicator that he is not neutral here. <br />   More importantly, for Hawkins to act as if outright deception is not occurring speaks to one's ability to deal with reality. For a person with 80 years of conditioned perception of reality to have reality turned on its head, a person could have a serious breakdown. <br /> <br />   The gift in this 4th book is that Hawkins has shown us what thekinesiological technique can and cannot be used for. It can be used by the sincere truthseeker for his/herself. However, it is not to be used to show one a reality they are not ready to see. There is no technique to make one see the truth. One's clear and sincere intention is all that can do that. And even then, one may not be ready to handle the fullness of reality. The process of how one \\"wakes up\\" is yet to be known. <br />   Who better than Hawkins to show us that experience is no substitute for impartiality? So, the readers of his 4th book get the opportunity to discern what is truth and what is his belief. The first 3 books prepared us, and the 4th is the test. Although he didn't intend it to work this way, it is the greatest gift of all. And just as importantly, it shows us that one can be quite enlightened in one area, while not having it all together in another. Even when one crosses the 600 line, one is still assailed by falsity and ignorance and must be constantly vigilant and unattached to one's beliefs.  <br /> <br />   And realistically, it couldn't have happened any other way. Given Hawkins' first 3 books and his audience, if he gave us the absolute truth about all the deceptions that make up the current perceived reality, it could have seriously messed some people up. It could result in serious mental breakdown if it was said that there aren't actually arab terrorists creating terror in America. So, the book had to be presented this way. And those of us who know the real truth know it through our own inner knowing already and don't need Hawkins to tell us. <br />   In `The Art of War', Sun Tzu said, \\"All warfare is based on deception.\\" Well, currently we have warfare in nearly every form. Even `necessary' and `justified' wars have deception as their roots. <br /> <br />Michael <br />Santa Fe, New Mexico	2005-10-14

I have searched and searched for a great Arthurian retelling and have been disappointed with the ones I have ventured into reading. I was somewhat skeptical when I picked up Nancy McKenzie's Queen of Camelot. This two-novels-in-one compilation is based on Guenevere, from her point of view, in first person narrative, and is 623 pages long in very small print. I didn't want to waste my time reading something this big only to be disappointed at the end. I nevertheless gave the book a whirl. Glad I did! This is one of the most compelling and beautifully told retells I have ever read! McKenzie gives us a detailed story about Guenevere from her point of view. She tells us about the prophecy on the day she was born, how she spends her childhood as an adventurous tomboy, how people fear her and treat her differently as she grows up, how the knights around her battle with the Saxons, and how all of the prophecies come true. She meets Arthur, marries him and later has a love affair with Lancelot, something based on the original tale. But the novel has so much more than that. You will see how this story of magic, prophecies, love and betrayal transpires in an altered, detailed and beautiful light. There are many twists throughout the novel.<br /><br />Guenevere is developed in such an abundant, three-dimensional way in this novel. She is no longer just the pagan beauty who marries a Christian, betrays him and destroys all of Camelot as a result. She is a complex character with flaws as well as virtues in this offering. Arthur is also written in a more interesting, compelling way here, but it is Lancelot that once again blows me away. I have always romanticized Sir Lancelot and McKenzie does not disappoint me in her version of the loyal, chivalrous knight. Merlin and Morgan Le Fay are written with much complexity and nuance as well. This novel, however, does not focus so much on the love triangle between Guenevere, Arthur and Lancelot as much as her inability to supply an heir for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent. Once again, I say that McKenzie did a wonderful job bringing Guenevere to life. She turns this character into a strong, intelligent, complex, three-dimensional, flesh and blood woman, someone you will feel a great deal of affinity with. She is not portrayed as a simple-minded, traitorous hussy in this one! I loved the fanciful storytelling style that made me turn the pages until the wee hours of the night. Some of my friends who read the book along with me complained about it being too long-winded. I didn't think it was long-winded at all. In fact, I wish it had been longer. I loved this book and I look forward to giving Grail Prince a whirl.for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent.

The protagonist of the story is obviously the boy(Robin Graham, because he was the main character.

US	34103525	R2IUKLDR8YOU3B	0674011929	707555499	Nero	Books	4	17	17	N	Y	The man, the monster, the legend.	Champlin bravely asserts his own contribution to the great wealth of Neronian scholarship for the critics to pick apart. I find very little to quibble about.<br />It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddled while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.<br /><br />Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and calculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter, is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Some reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compelling to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with his great intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advancing his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The discussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves as an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weaving together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward proving them. His presentation however, is replete with past scholarship and primary sources presented candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusions is the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. This book has been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empowering enough to read further with confidence.ngly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

So I also asked to proofread \\"Dawn of a Thousand Nights: A Story of Honor.\\" Again, I was definitely NOT disappointed! I literally had to MAKE myself slow down so I could proofread carefully! I was hooked from the first page. It's definitely a 5-star book--a fascinating read, sad because of Pearl Harbor & other elements but also hopeful. It also takes place in WWII. We are there at Pearl Harbor; we are there with the women fliers (WAFS/WASPS) who transported planes across the country to free up male pilots for the war (one of the aspects of WWII I didn't know about until this book). We are also there in the Philippines, including the Bataan Death March & the horrid Japanese POW camps. Yet even through some of the worst circumstances of the war, this gifted author shows us that God truly cares & loves each of His children, & He can & will bring victory out of defeat. Such a powerful message of hope, love, & grace!       Historical figures are included, but the fiction & history mesh well. Readers even get to \\"see\\" from a Japanese point of view. The characters are compelling; I couldn't wait to know what happened to them! There is a touch of romance, but it's not overdone. This book is much more about the history, the people who lived it, and what they experienced during WWII. It's packed with emotions from those historical events: realism, fear, hope, faith, & love in the midst of extremely difficult times...& the gamut of emotions those who lived through WWII experienced. This is truly a unique and compelling book with characters who have depth & conflicts; I felt like I was there in each of the three main character's minds. Each of the chapters starts with actual historical newspaper excerpts, which adds a unique realism not always found in novels.      I have proofed well over 600 books, & I write reviews on VERY few. But Tricia Goyer's books are, quite simply, excellent!I have not found another author like her, and I am immensely thankful that I got to work on this book. I had to have \\"Night Song,\\" and since I didn't get to proof that, I bought it. Even though \\"Dawn\\" may seem like a long book, it's well worth your time! I love historical books that I can \\"sink my teeth into\\"--ones that have depth and a great story mixed with history--not short, shallow books that only use history as a backdrop or setting.     This book was my jumping-off place to learn more about the war in the Pacific & the Bataan Death March. If you love WWII historical novels, you won't be able to put this book down! It has stayed with me since May 2004! Don't miss this! I'm so glad I didn't. :-)     I've already asked the publisher if I can proofread Tricia Goyer's next book. I can hardly wait! :-) I cannot recommend   this book highly enough! Enjoy!	2005-10-14

I can say that I've read up to the point where the acquired Abby as a new sitter, but I spotted \\"Graduation Day\\" and had to read it. I feel that I \\"grew up\\" with these girls--even though they are still 13 and I am now 23. The ending of a favorite series is bittersweet. Months ago, \\"passed the torch\\" to my 8 year old niece. On the first day of summer, I mailed her a copy of Kristy's Great Idea. She has fallen in love with the BSC and has now taken over the collection. When I went back home a few weeks ago, I had to smile when I saw a copy of \\"Claudia's Goodbye\\" in my old chair at the table.  <br />\\"Graduation Day\\" was terrific. The perfect ending to a wonderful coming-of age series. Goodbye, Girls.	2005-10-14

As is the case with many adventure books it is obvious that the author is not a professional writer. If you are looking for a well written book this is going to be a disappointment. If you don't care so much about the writing and just want to learn of a remarkable athletic/mental accomplishment this is a good book.  <br /> <br />Anyone familiar with ultrarunning will be familiar with the Badwater course. No doubt they will also be in awe of the Badwater course. It is viewed by some as the pinnacle of human endurance and the high point of ultrarunning in general. <br /> <br />Richard Benyo makes the Badwater race look like a jog through the park. He ran an out and back from the scorching floor of Death Valley to the windy and cold peak of Mt. Whitney and back. What makes it even more impressive is tha the did this years ago before the advent of energy gels, high performance sports drink, wicking fabrics and high tech running shoes. <br /> <br />This book probably won't appeal to non runners or even casual runners but anyone serious about running or human endurance will most likely appreciate it.	2005-10-14

In The Shadow Within, Abramm comes home to Kiriath to claim his crown after the death of his last older brother. His arrival is heralded by a sea-monster hunt of epic proportions, which leaves Abramm open to accusations of sorcery and deceit. Abramm must contend with various family members and nobles, unaware of his fame as a professional fighter and skeptical of his ability to reign, and with trouble on the borders and neighboring countries. Complicating matters is a Chesedhan princess who insists on digging up his past and composing heroic songs of his exploits. But the greatest threat to Abramm and the realm is a creature born of sorcery and malice, blood-bonded to Abramm himself, created to destroy him and open the way for dark forces to control the throne of Kiriath through his younger brother. <br /> <br /> At this point, especially after re-reading the story, I've lost all objectivity about Karen Hancock's writing, or her stories, and have become a total fangirl. Though many other CBA authors have been compared to J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, none others have come so close to matching the scope and wonder of these two classic, beloved authors. I was thoroughly drawn into this segment of the tale and found my affections unexpectedly engaged not only by Abramm himself, all over again, but various secondary characters-Uncle Simon, Lady Madeleine, and the boy servant, Jared. More depth is given to Abramm's twin sister Carissa, as she must face her lingering rancor over Abramm's spiritual decisions. And the crowning point of the book is a marvel of love, faith, and the power of true fellowship. <br /> <br /> It's no surprise that The Shadow Within won the author her third Christy award for the third year in a row. Along with other dedicated Hancock fans, I wait with bated breath for Shadow Over Kiriath, the next installment of the four-part Legends of the Guardian King, due out November 2005. <br />	2005-10-14

I hung on to the book for several years and then, one hurricane week, without electricity and no work, I lit a candle and sat down to read ORENDA.  It has become one of my favorite books. Steeped in history, with a tale so compelling that I almost couldn't bear to finish it, I rushed out and bought all the other Kate Cameron (a.k.a. Beverly McGlamry) books I could find.  She is a writer of inestimable talent.  Her tale, while fictional, is woven within the tight constraints of factual history, so there are moments of gruesome reality. But this is juxtapositioned against a story of beauty, family, land and loss.  You needn't be particularly interested in the saga of the Iroquois Nation (on which this book is based) but I promise that you will be drawn in as easily as I was, to a world I never knew about.  This is a story beautifully told, of great moments and tragic ones, all exquisitely written with the true hand of a master historian.	2005-10-14

The United States has made some fundamental changes in its foreign policy as a result of the 9/11 attacks. These largely center around the almost unilateral decisions to change the governments of Afghanistan and Iraq. The United States had the power to do this, and exercised that power.  <br /> <br />It appeared unlikely that the US would get UN approval or a UN based coalition to work together. France and Russia were getting favorable oil pricing from Iraq in exchange for weapons and would likely veto any decision in the Security Council. The addition of numerous Islamic states into the General Assembly. So the decision was made to proceed anyway. It was certainly popular with the American people still operating in great anger after 9/11.  <br /> <br />Americans tend to believe with an almost religious fervor that our way is best, that the America system (under God) is clearly the way that the world should work. Americans believe that their global actions are benevolent, that the rest of the world is almost child like, and should look up to us as a father.  <br /> <br />The rest of the world doesn't exactly agree. The Islamic countries look at the US support of Israel and see a contempt for Islam. Europe looks at the US with some alarm. President Bush is often viewed as some kind of pistol packing Texas cowboy.  <br /> <br />Any book like this is a snapshot of the situation at a given time as seen by one person, the author. He certainly presents an interesting fview of other states worred about US dominance and who are starting to turn their concerns into action.  <br /> <br />It's an interesting book to read now, and it will be interesting to read in ten years or so to see just how a good a predictor Dr. Walt turns out to be.	2005-10-14

I just have to say that AH is a superior dictionary for everyday use.     I work for companies that maintain online dictionaries, and am, among other things responsible for comparing the contents of these lists with the latest published dictionaries to ascertain which entries should be deleted and which new ones included. I find that AH very rarely has bad judgement with respect to selection of entries.     Perhaps the reason another reviewer didn't find Carl Gauss or Reimann is because their names are actually Karl Gauss and Riemann. And I appreciate the fact that AH has gone a long way toward rectifying the perception conveyed by most older biographical dictionaries that all great people have been white, European and male. We need Gauss in there of couse, but we also need Robeson and St. Vincent Millay who won a Pulitzer Prize just like Frost, and who wrote just as beautifully.     Its goal obviously is to both be a desktop dictionary in a single volume, and yet include the words that educated American speakers are likely to encounter in modern, non-technical publications. (And yes, it is an American dictionary, which is why colour is defined as 'Chiefly British, variant of color'.) This objective becomes harder and harder to achieve as the base of English-speaking people expands, and the Internet makes so many more things available to the average reader. The average person may use words like 'alacrity' less often than they did 200 years ago, but in point of fact, the average person's active vocabulary is expanding.     I prefer the way they organize their word senses to what Webster does. (I never compare things to the OED, because that is a work of art, deserving of veneration.) It reserves entirely new entries for an entirely unrelated sense. AH will give iris(flower) and iris(of the eye) two different senses, but Webster's gives (though not entirely consistently) the nominal and verbal senses of, say, 'claim' entirely different entries. AH includes them under the same entry, because they are semantically very closely related.     The etymological Appendix of AH is also kind of famous among linguists. They have very nicely systematized and cross-referenced their entries against their hypothesized Indo-European roots. It's quite well researched, and also a lot of fun.	2005-10-14

I thought of several different ways in which to begin this review - several witty comparisons that would surely catch the reader's attention. But that was a month and a half ago. See, I started reading Blue Like Jazz on the 20th of July and it is now the 4th of October. I have four pages left and I'm not sure I have the strength to continue.    For you see: Donald Miller is wearying. Endlessly self-amused and self-absorbed, he seems to want nothing so much as to be hip, cool, edgy (despite his own protests that hip, edgy, and cool are vanities and wastes of time and energy). And if four years of highschool taught me anything, it is that everyone with a heart is thoroughly and deeply embarrassed when the Very Not Cool Guy walks in and tries to be cool. Think: The Offspring's \\"Pretty Fly for a White Guy.\\"    The thing is: Christianity cannot be cool. There is no reason non-believers should see Christianity as anything even on the same plane as Cool. Christianity says and believes terrifying things about the non-believer. Forget the homosexuals a minute - Christianity says that the friendly, tax-paying, socially-active, community-leading paragon of virtue who doesn't bow the knee to Christ is horribly wicked and an actual enemy of God. No matter how kind and cool they are. For Christianity to become cool, it has to stop having anything to do with Christ and his message. Maybe Donald Miller wants that. It kinda seems like it, but who can say - since he's not that great at expressing anything beyond his own meandering and fleeting feelings on matters.    About two-thirds into the book, a friend (who won't receive an identity via nickname, such as Tony the Beat Poet or Andrew the Protester) asked me what kind of a book it was. I had a hard time describing it at first. Then I realized: \\"OMG!! I'm reading a blog on paper! LOL!!\\" Really, Miller's book is nothing more than a glorified blog in its meandering promise to get to a point that never comes. In reality, Miller wouldmake a much better blogger than he does a writer. Unfortunately, even as a blogger, he would only be so good - because despite moments of value and bits that come close to insight, his style is heavy-handed and obvious for too much of the book's 240 pages (I know, only 240 pages and it's taken me almost two-and-a-half months!).     One good-but-obvious point Miller makes throughout the book is that the human expression of Christianity in the contemporary American church is lacking at best, gravely flawed at worst, but most likely, somewhere in between. This is clearly true. But also clearly known to probably most of us. And the real problems are not often the ones that Miller is pointing out - he seems frequently upset at how little the church fits in with a world filled with lovely sinners. Yet still, there is value in his critique.    But not much. Again Miller shows himself to be like too many bloggers; and like too many bloggers, he has much criticism and too few answers. If he were a blogger, this might be acceptable; after all, the only cost associated with reading a blog is time (and perhaps mental health). A book, however, is paid in currency. There is real loss if a book does not measure up to its published value - and Blue Like Jazz does not. I hate to say that because there are a few amusing stories and I get the feeling the book wants to be useful - but it just isn't.	2005-10-14

The Autobiography of Ramtha's life <br />Part 2.  The Fundamental concepts of the teachings. <br /> <br /> <br />The Introductory Essay describes the background to Ramtha's teachings and highlights their uniqueness.  Not only do they address the fundamental questions of our origins and nature, but they deliver a comprehensive legacy of knowledge based on pure reason and science.  Coupled with this, are disciplines which give the student a means to experience and verify the philosophical aspects of the teachings, thus consolidating the knowledge as their own wisdom and personal truth. <br />Ramtha's School of Enlightenment (RSE) is likened to the ancient mystery schools of Egypt, Greece and Persia.  As a school, it provides the fertile ground in which the student can expand and liberate their mind from their old indoctrinations and find their freedom through the exploration of their spiritual nature. <br /> <br /> <br />Part 1 <br />Ramtha the Enlightened One talks of his life 35,000 years ago and what led him to become a great warrior and conqueror.  He describes his recovery after being run through by a sword which led to his own self mastery and final ascension in front of his 2 million strong army. <br /> <br /> <br />Part 2 <br />Ramtha discusses our origins from the Void, the creation of time and the eventual evolution of the human form.  He describes the nature of God - the Observer and how reality is formed.  In addition, he explains how the brain works, the electromagnetic field around the body and how we can change.  He also addresses the concept of hope and the problems we experience with doubt and how every thought we have is constantly shaping our reality <br /> <br /> <br />This is a fabulous book for anyone seeking answers to these fundamental questions.  Itis especially complementary with many of the popular quantum physics books such as The Self Aware Universe by Amit Gotswami, The Field by Lynne McTaggart or Parallel Universes by Fred Alan Wolf. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-14

In his foreword to the third edition, Aitken Roshi stated:   <br /> <br /> \\"this revised edition . . .now includes many new translations and studies of Dogen, and thus it is most welcome. Dogen wrote at the outermost edge of human communication, touching with every sentence such mysteries as self and other, self and non-self, meditation and realization, the temporal and the timeless, forms and the void.@He wrote of the attitude necessary for understanding, of the practice required. . .of the various insights that emerge, and of the many pitfalls. He did not generally write for beginners - most of his points require very careful study and a few of them elude almost everybody. These challenges are compounded by his creative use of the Japanese language. It has been said that he wrote in \\"Dogenese,\\" for he made verbs of nouns, nouns of verbs, created new metaphors, and manipulated old sayings to present his particular understanding. . . \\"  <br /> <br /> Prof. Kim's study has been based on a careful reading of Dogen's chosen idioms. He has endeavoured to amplify Dogen's understanding of 'do-ri' - or 'reason of the way.' Kim is keen to show that Dogen's use of Zen language is not merely provisional or instrumental, but embodies a 'realisational' dimension. This is exemplified in the notion of the 'genjo-koan' or koan realised in the present, which is to say, actualised in every day activity. In this way, Kim endeavours to show that Dogen's Zen culminates in ' the great way of total exertion' (gujin no daido) or the total actualisation of practice as realization. Kim is a foremost interpreter of Dogen's thought - and, as such, this book deserves a place in every Buddhist library. My only reservation about this study, is that it might have made better sense of the question of how the so-called 'instrumentalist' aspect of koan practice relates tothe 'realizational' aspect. Quite rightly, Kim is at pains to point out that accounts of Zen which stress the 'instrumentalist' view of koan practice - and that alone, are one sided, and he has therefore endeavoured to illustrate a different perspective. However, without reflection, we might be left to conclude that Rinzai Zen favours the 'instrumentalist' view - and Soto, the 'realizational' view. Kim knows better, and indeed, in places (p. 165), he has cited certain remarks from Dogen, which concede that the term 'genjo-koan' originated with Engo - a Rinzai master of the Sung, evidently meaning that Rinzai practitioners have appreciated the 'realizational' aspect. As such, the critical references to (Dai-e) Ta-hui which appear elsewhere in the book, seem strangely out of tenor with this fact. Yuan-wu (Engo) was Ta-hui's teacher, and the latter must surely have known of his master's references to the genjo-koan. Conversely, much as we might identify Dogen's Zen with 'shikantaza' (just-sitting), playing down the instrumentalist approach, Dogen also had his experience of 'casting off mind and body' (shinjindatsuraku) - a breakthrough experience more or less akin to that realised by Rinzai followers. Perhaps Prof. Kim will enlighten us on this unresolved problem, at some future point.	2005-10-14

I loved the fact that, in the end, the only thing she cared more about than couture was her kid. It made her loveable and human. Her story is more than a sexual history.

The Baroque cycle is a study in intricate plots, characters that seem to number in the thousands, and difficult material that is not readily accessible to the average novel reader.  The Cryptonomicon met that description as well, but to a lesser degree.  While I enjoyed those books precisely for their complexity, many readers probably found them to be frustrating to read and difficult to follow. <br />  <br />The Stephen Bury novels do not present this problem for the casual reader.  They are stripped of most of the technical lingo, and they tend to follow more in the footsteps of modern thrillers.  The difference between these novels and the average Tom Clancy clone is that they revolve around powerful critiques of modern political cultures and bureacracies. <br /> <br />The Cobweb is the better of these two novels.  The central critique of the intelligence community is that competence without political acumen is tantamount to career suicide.  The book tracks the months between Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and the start of Gulf War I and poses a terrifying question: what if the greatest enemies to our national security are the egomaniacs at the top of the security apparatus?  Given the events that have transpired in between the writing of this novel and today, the question raised by this novel seems prescient. <br /> <br />The one thing that is lacking from the Stephen Bury novels is the decadence of Stephenson's other works.  Stephenson is a novelist who has spent pages discussing the Captain Crunch-eating ritual of one of his characters (Cryptonomicon), the making of watered steel blades (the Baroque Cycle), and other incidental but vastly entertaining subjects too numerous to mention.  These passages exquisitely sideline the plots of his books for an exercise in pure intellectual indulgence.  Sadly, you will not find any such passages in this novel or in Interface.	2005-10-14

Daniel Boorstin feels that \\"the greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance; it is the illusion of knowledge.\\"  Napolean who lost the Battle at Waterloo, stated: \\"A battle sometimes decides everything; and sometimes the merest trifle decides a battle\\" and \\"In war, as in love, we must come into contact before we can triumph.\\"    Accius is quoted as saying :Oderint, dum metuant.  Let them hate, so long as they fear.\\"   He waxes poetic with Shelley, \\"To that high Capital, where kingly Death keeps his pale court in beauty and decay, He came.\\"  Shakespeare qualifies for three quotes, \\"As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods; They kill us for their sport,\\" \\"\\"It is to be all made of faith and service...it is to be all made of fantasy,\\" and \\"I am as true as truth's simplicity, and simpler than the infancy of truth.\\"    This is in the form of a narrative by Mason Dunne.  \\"I was in combat, no doubt about it, but I was detached from it.  I knew then that I had to be a Ghost Knight.  I saw another vision.\\"  The fish sees the bait, but not the hook.  George Bernard Shaw wrote \\"He who bears the brand of Cain shall rule the earth.\\"  There are references from the Bible, even one by Jeremiah (prophet of doom).  Sam Donelly tells how he procured a hovercab, Mad Cat III, from a rental agency -- a Cabochon, the most popular model because of its safety construction.  \\"The display was breathtaking and, I'll admit, I'd just started to drift unconsciously past,\\" in vino veritas, was told, 'You don't look like a ghost to me.  \\"No, my friend, I don't, which is exactly why I am one.\\"    Others in this series of Dark Age, LETHAL HERITAGE, BLOOD LEGACY, and LOST DESTINY, are from the Blood of Kerensky.

US	52562189	R32QC0QE07NJTB	B0006DD4XG	713155335	Beggar on Horseback, a Play in Two Parts	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Head in the Clouds	George S. Kaufman & Marc Connelly teamed up to write this play that was first presented in New York in 1924.  It is an adaptation of a 1911 German play by Paul Apel whose translated title is \\"Johnny Sunstormer's Trip to Hell.\\"  Kaufman & Connelly thoroughly Americanized the piece.  It is an example of expressionism, where the character's inner life is reflected in decidedly non-realistic stage terms.<br /><br />Neil McRae is a struggling composer who has caught the eye of Cynthia Mason who lives across the hall.  She helps tether Neil's feet to the ground regarding appointments and the necessity to complete work.  Neil's head is in the clouds, dreaming of the symphony he seems to not find time to write.  A buddy of Neil's from his hometown of Livingston, Dr. Albert Rice, drops in for a visit.  This happens just as a family from their hometown also drops in for a visit.  Mr. & Mrs. Cady come with their son Homer and their daughter Gladys.  Mr. Cady is a wealthy but grumpy entrepreneur.  Homer is also a businessman who seems tied to the phone making business calls while Gladys is a debutante socialite concerned with the color of her dresses.  Gladys for some unknown reason has a crush on Neil and pursues him.  His buddy Albert who sees Neil wasting his time giving lessons rather than writing encourages him to marry Gladys as a way to help him out of his money woes.  Although Neil has an eye for Cynthia across the hall, she also sees how he'd be more able to write his music if he marries into the wealthy family.  After the Cady's leave, Cynthia rejects Neil for his own good, although she deeply cares for him.  This causes Neil to pick up the phone and propose to Gladys who gushes that she can now start telling all her friends and planning engagement parties.  Dr. Albert, seeing that Neil is near exhaustion, orders him to bed.  Neil falls asleep thus starting the main part of the play, which is an extended expressionistic dream sequence.<br /><br />In the dream, locations fade from one to another where Mr. Cady makes Neil join the family business.  Everytime Neil wants to work on writing music, there is always another party to which Gladys drags him.  Frustrated and increasingly unhappy, Neil is finally put in an art manufacturing company where songwriters turn out nice jazz tunes that will sell a million and a half.  Ideas come from the inspiration department and are forwarded to the composer who dashes off the tune.  Writers turn out books that copy much of the plot from their previous book to meet publishing deadlines that results in books being distributed 45 minutes after they are written.  Neil's agony increases to the point where he picks up a paper knife and kills Mr. & Mrs. Cady, his wife Gladys and his brother-in-law Homer.  This starts an epic trial where tickets for jurors are sold like movie theatre tickets and the jurors are dancing instructors who dance with Gladys.  The judge is none other than the dead Mr. Cady and the deceased Mrs. Cady comes back as a witness.  Albert becomes the prosecuting attorney and objections are made to Neil's looks.  The jury does not care for Neil's looks and convicts him.  This ends the dream.<br /><br />Gladys shows up to inquire if they could postpone their engagement because she's run into one of her old boyfriends who wants to show her the city; and of course, he wouldn't be comfortable doing so if she's engaged.  Neil and Gladys decide they are not meant for each other which allows Neil to set his sights back on Cynthia who has now returned and is willing to settle for a life that is less successful but is filled with love.<br /><br />It is an interesting play, one that would require a legion of stagehands and set designers to produce effectively.  It is an indictment of business vs. art, something with which both Kaufman & Connelly seem extremely knowledgeable.  I couldn't quite figure out what the title had to do with the play, but I did appreciate reading this great example ofAmerican expressionism.  Enjoy!xample of American expressionism.  Enjoy! <br /> <br />	2005-10-14

As a physician and early American history buff I was really looking forward to learning more about Benjamin Rush.<br /><br />In general it seems that the author, despite putting out what appears to be a finished, presentable biography, never really dug into source materials to find out who Benjamin Rush was and why he was important.  Repeatedly, we hear of Rush's fame and accomplishments and influence, but the details are missing.<br /><br />We hear what a great doctor Rush was, considered the preeminent physician of his times, according to the author, but all the author writes about is how Rush tortured his patients with medical treatments we now know are harmful, such as bloodletting, giving cathartics, etc.  Rush is known as the \\"Father of American Psychiatry\\", his book on psychiatry was bible for many many years, and his observations on mental illness were in many ways way way ahead of his times...yet not a word of this is mentioned except in the last ten pages of this 365 page book.  This subject desperately needed to explained.  This is why he is important for heaven's sake.<br /><br />Furthermore, I think it would have been fascinating to have gotten a better feel for what bloodletting and giving cathartics was about, we needed some good old source material, firsthand observations and then-current thoughts, as well as an expose of the tools employed, etc.  Rush, it is clear, considered himself first and foremost and physician.  He dedicated his life to the practice of medicine, he was considered a top academic lecturer.  We are told all the top American physicians for the next half century were either disciples of Rush or disciples of his students.....but we don't really get a feeling for why.<br /><br />His political contributions and inolvement were similarly neglected.  Although he wasn't the political calibre of Hamilton or Jefferson, he was definitely a major player.  Much of the earlier portion of the biography seemed to focus on explaining the political events occurring around Rush during the fight for independence.  The focus should have been Rush.  There's a lot of negativity surrounding Rush early on in the book, but how he seems to know all the important figures in the Revolution and why they respect him is not explained.<br /><br />There also weren't any pictures or illustrations.  I could go on.  On the bright side, at least the book reads well.  If you want to learn more about Rush, you should probably choose another book.  Sorry.	2005-10-14

Or whenever Britney Spears,  Christina Aguliera, Jessica Simpson, and Sex and the City burst onto the pop culture radar. <br /> <br />Levy's writing style is easy to read, not at all distracting like some other writers in this genre, like Naomi Wolf, who take the focus off the material. I really apreciate the chapter devoted to the women's movement since I was born years after and the women's studies class i recently took failed to cover it. That chapter puts some things in perspective for me. Read this book. You will not be disappointed.	2005-10-14

For anyone who loves horses, mules, romance, camping and the Mountain West, High Country has been well worth the wait. In this action packed story, Wyman masterfully tells of Ty Hardin, son of a Bitteroot Valley rancher, who leaves the farm during the Depression for a packer's life in Montana's Swan Range. Ty learns the ropes from a Fenton Pardee, a veteran guide, who also becomes his mentor and close friend. Tending to dudes and hunters, crossing snowbound passes, fording swollen rivers, encounters with bogs and bears, mule wrecks of epic proportions - and coming of age in town -  High Country captures the fears, dreams and fantasies of all who live for life on the trail. <br /> <br />This book is a tale of riveting adventure, romantic love, profound sadness and natural beauty which is hard to put down. I honestly didn't want it to end. On one hand it is unique simply because it focuses on the packing industry and its culture - topics which, as literature, haven't been seen much on the printed page.  <br /> <br />On the other, more than just a first in its genre (does another packer's adventure novel even exist?), High Country is also a profound description of the people and landscapes all of us as westerners love - high country landscapes, before coffee table books, when wilderness was something to be experienced fist hand.  <br /> <br />High Country is a book you'll want to throw in your saddlebags  and talk about around the campfire. Like your favorite camping trip, warm memories of High Country will last long into the night. If you like the Mountain West, this is a great read in every way. I promise you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />	2005-10-14

First-rate historian and author Niall Ferguson offers a politically incorrect interpretation of the four-century history of the British Empire. Sure, he acknowledges that the imperialists stole, murdered and enslaved on their way to world domination. Yet, Ferguson argues, the Brits spread several traditions, including liberty, democracy and free trade, which improved the state of the world. To Ferguson's credit, he makes no attempt to gloss over the Empire's atrocities. In fact, with stellar prose, he takes the risk of undermining his central theme by describing the Empire's bad behavior in great detail. His conclusions are as complex as history itself, which might prove frustrating to readers seeking simple answers. We strongly recommend this memoir to readers who love history, and particularly to those seeking a historical perspective on the pitfalls of imperialism.	2005-10-14

It seems the whole area is infested with the spiders who take the heads of humans, except for a temple which is inhabited by Nazuna and a wizened priest. But when the spiders break into the temple, Inuyasha is at a loss because it just happens to be the time in all half-demons lives when they lose their demonic power and become fully human for a short time! Our heroes will have to use their brains instead of brawn this time. After that they will have to deal with a witch that steals Kikyo's bones in an effort to resurrect the priestess that imprisoned Inuyasha for 50 years!  <br /> <br />What can I say about any work by Rumiko Takahasi? They are probably the best manga out there! She is a genius! The great thing about this volume is that we learn a bit more about the past conflict between Inuyasha and Kikyo and that their relationship was a bit more \\"involved\\" than we were led to believe. It wasn't just a simple battle for the possession of the Shikon Jewel. The twist of making Inuyasha become a human for a night was also a clever twist in the plot. Rumiko seems full of surprises in what is essentially an action manga. Excellent work!	2005-10-14

I have little interest in or knowledge of designer clothes or the fashion world, and I don't subscribe to or read any fashion magazines.  That was exactly why I passed by this book several times before finally picking it up this weekend.  I thought it was going to be some story with a character I couldn't possibly relate to-- someone steeped in fashion who only cared about appearance.   <br /> <br />When I read the first few pages with Andrea IN the designer clothes, I thought I was right... but to my pleasant surprise, the main character turned out to be someone I could relate to and respect.  As a recent college graduate, I know from personal experience that the prospect of finding a job... getting a job... and trying to figure out a career are incredibly common to anyone in the relative age range of 21-24.  It's no easy task to deal with a first \\"real\\" job and the trials it provides while keeping an eye out for what comes next, because, inevitably, there will be a next.  No one stays in their first, entry-level, junky job, but this is a perfect read for the people who ARE in their first, entry-level, junky jobs. <br /> <br />What I found most impressive about this book is the way that, just like Andrea gets sucked into the lifestyle surrounding her job, the reader gets sucked into her goals for the future and how the job will get here there.  Towards the end, even as you realize it's wrong, it's so easy to rationalize (along with Andrea) that this is what she needs to do to secure her future; that she only has a few more weeks left-- all the while knowing deep down that, really, it's totally ridiculous.   <br /> <br />If you've ever had or have a boss who drives you insane for any reason, this is a great book to read because it will show you that your boss is a picnic in the park.  Well worth the read.	2005-10-14

This was just the kind of romance novel I love. Wonderful characters. Characters that seem real because they are not perfect-something most novels like this lack. There are interesting plot twists and we get to know several secondary characters well. The secondary characters are not boring. The chemistry between Brianna and Michael was very sensual and immediate. The heroine is the perfect foil for the hero's cynicism and intellect. It was written with an amazing level of intensity and feeling that my heart was pumping furiously with both the palatable passion and the keen sense of danger infused in the story. Brianna and Michael were both wounded, intriguing, complex, wonderful characters. The action/suspense was fast-paced and thrilling. The setting was beautiful and exotic. The sex was HOT and perfect for the story. Melody Thomas stories are humorous, romantic and interesting - and she is excellent and creating characters that are real, interesting people - and that you remember vividly from book to book throughout the series. You want to know them better! I love the Donally family. This is the second book I have read from Melody Thomas and I love them both. I'm looking forward to reading more about the Donally family. All I can say in conclusion is if you like a good, emotional, heart-tugging historical, with characters that leap off the pages, buy  Must Have Been The Moonlight.	2005-10-14

Countless Americans patiently trace genealogies and histories through slowly crumbling archives and weathering marble, seeking answers to questions about the ones who preceded us.   This is a story of the meaning of such a search to one searcher.  As the book's title alludes, Recovering Ruth: A Biographer's Tale focuses on how recovering Ruth Edgerton Douglass' history affects her biographer, Robert Root.  Parts of Ruth's journal are excerpted in Recovering Ruth, and those who are interested in reading her journal in its entirety can look to Time by Moments Steals Away: The 1848 Journal of Ruth Douglass, edited by Robert Root.  <br /> Root's task, as the book begins, is seemingly simple and straightforward: edit the 1848 journal of Mrs. C. C. Douglass for publication.  The Michigan library catalog attributes the authorship to Lydia Douglass, the clan matriarch who lived to be an octogenarian.  However, Root soon discovers that the journal was actually penned by the first Mrs. C. C. Douglass, Ruth Edgerton Douglass.  This discovery compels him to reconstruct the people and places of the mid-nineteenth century Michigan frontier, from the then-booming young city of Detroit to the remote Lake Superior outpost, Isle Royale.  Although his search begins in libraries and archives, he soon journeys to the places where Ruth triumphed over fears common to us all: loneliness, hardships, and loss.  <br /> In retracing her life's journey, Root travels from Detroit to Chicago to Lake Superior's Isle Royale. Root uses his carefully researched details to evoke the Michigan Ruth would have known.  He describes their approach of Isle Royale thus: \\"At last the island begins to rise in the distance, a long thin line above the water that slowly thickens as we thump our way steadily across the waves\\" (109).  His language not only shows the vastness of the Great Lake, but also the treachery and danger inherent in crossing the world's largest freshwater lake even for a modern traveler.  Imagery such as this gives us insight into the courage and determination of settlers such as the Douglasses. <br /> During the course of his timely yet timeless search, Root comes to realize that he is in search of the meaning not only of Ruth's life, but of his own.  As Root says, \\"Perhaps I needed to recover Ruth in order to keep from losing myself\\" (xvi).  History is comprised of a series of chance meetings and fortunate accidents not readily apparent by perusing a family tree.  Our lives would be immeasurably different if our great-grandparents had decided that it was, after all, too difficult to make their way by wagon train westward to Kansas, if our grandmother had stayed home rather than attended a dance, if our father's soulful brown eyes hadn't met our mother's at a crowded wedding.  Root directly acknowledges those subconscious murmurs: \\"Genealogy identifies lines of descent, who begat whom, the aftermath of events; what it doesn't recount are the myriad alternatives barely missed, the intangibles of attraction and attachment, the possibilities avoided, ignored, or rejected\\" (25).  In recovering Ruth's story, Root sees the ways in which his own choices will impact the future course of history: a painful divorce, a hopeful remarriage, his beloved children.   <br /> Root's work serves as a window for us to view the interconnections between our world and Ruth's.  As George Eliot wrote at the end of Middlemarch, \\"the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.\\"  In Recovering Ruth, Root has recorded Ruth's historic acts and unveiled her hidden life.    <br />     This book was chosen by the Library of Michigan as a 2004 Michigan Notable Book.	2005-10-14

I would say only that before Hard Time John was a bastard, but he always seemed at least a little sorry for it. With Azrillo, the wishy washyness slipped completely away to reveal John for the conniving, sadistic unapologetic bastard everybody always thought he was. <br />Which isn't to say I liked Azrillo. He did horrible things to the character and the supporting cast, but in many ways his mark has been left. <br />If Carey's first collection, Red Sepulchre, attempted to crawl out of the ditch Hellblazer was left in, Black Flowers represents Carey, not to use an obvious metephor, in full bloom. <br />I expected great things from Carey the moment I heard he was takeing the reigns. Judging from the complex, continuing storylines of Lucifer, I figured this for a man who dreams up issues years ahead of schedule. <br />Yet for all its achievments with reoccuring plot threads, Hellblazer has never been much for one long, linked storyline. Until now... <br />I would not have believed he would try to tie in Red Sepulchre, in itself an impressive storyline, with anything larger. But in this I committed the inexcusible sin of underestimating Mike Carey. In this collection, he takes up the tone of his other magnificent works and makes Hellblazer unmistakably his own, without oweing apologies to anyone else. <br />His work is not at all choppy, each episode proceeds naturally into the next. But don't mistake continous and flowing for predictable, Carey is also the master of dropping little hints that never make sense until the puzzle is assembled. And then you realize what you thought of as the whole puzzle is but a piece of something larger. That is the joy. <br />But I'm rambling. The two-part title arc is perhaps the most other-wordly story I have read in some time, and the Three Doors story arc represents John at his con-man best. Nothing is ever as it seems, and Carey presents just enough information to let you think youknow what's going on. When all is said and done, you feel like you should have known what was going to happen, but you never can. <br />And the best is yet to come. Judging by the hints dropped in this book, and the way they simply beg for more information, Black Flowers will have Hellblazer fans and lovers of mystery and dark fantasy stories pleading for more. <br />Mike Carey is just getting started.	2005-10-14

Welsh is a wonderful, ancient language that has survived on the fringe of the island of Great Britain despite the dominance of its now world-wide-dominant neighbour, English.  The literary works, particularly the poetry, has great power, even when translated into English, and English speakers can get a sense of the flavour of this Celtic language from the various worlds that have been absorbed into English.<br /><br />This course created by T. J. Rhys Jones (about as Welsh a name as they come) is a very easy, step-by-step process to learn what is in many ways a very difficult language - particularly for English speakers, whose language comes from Germanic and Latinate roots, going to a Celtic language which stems from a different tree is truly an excursion into foreign territory.  Rhys Jones has made this trip quite enjoyable, and quite do-able.<br /><br />Unlike English, Welsh pronunciation is a lot less flexible in terms of matching spelling to sound, so learning the pronunciation is a bit easier to do.  The grammar seciont also looks at the way words are put together - like many languages, there are colloquial expressions and multi-word phrases that stand in for single English words, and vice-versa.  Each unit starts with a brief dialogue, which is then analysed for vocabulary and for grammar structure, and any other points of interest.<br /><br />There is also an introductory section on mutations, the shift of a sound from one to another depending upon use - Rhys Jones gives the examples of road signs:  the word for Wales is Cymru, but a border sign when crossing into Wales might read Croeso i Gymru; similarly, the word for England is Lloegr, but the sign might read Croeso i Loegr.  This is a codification in letters of what happens in regular speech - we do not as a rule stop and start between each word, and the spelling in Welsh takes this into account.<br /><br />There are a few difficulties with the text. While Rhys Jones indicates that there are dialect differences, some of the words don't match what I heard while in Wales in any location.  As with any language text, I am more often to account the difficulty to myself than to the author of the instructional text.<br /><br />There is a glossary of words in the back, but I often found myself wishing it were a fuller dictionary rather than a simple word list.  There are exercises to work through, whose translations are found in the appendix, as well as more detailed tables on mutations, gender in language constructions, the special verb 'have', which in Welsh can be variously translated as gyda, cael, wedi, or rhaid.<br /><br />This is a useful text; used in connection with travel or a book of poetry (Dafydd ap Gwilym is one of my favourite poets).dialect differences, some of the words don't match what I heard while in Wales in any location.

I loved Fargo Rock City and Coca Puffs, but thought this was a little bit weaker going. The writing is great, but the story as such is just kind of not there. My personal feeling is that Klosterman needs to get a little more honest if he wants to attack this type of subject matter. It's still pretty funny, but feels a little forced. Personally, I liked the book Wrecking Crew by John Albert much more this year. Still a fan of Kosterman, but Wrecking Crew just seemed a better book. <br /> <br />	2005-10-14

Reviewers all over the country wrote reviews about how great it was. The initial sales were fantastic. It went immediately to a book club. Published in 18 (last I heard) countries. That was in the early summer of 2005. Switch to early fall. I see lots of places with the book for sale saying 'Publisher's Overstock.'  <br /> <br />John Twelve Hawks, the author, supposedly lives 'off the grid.' That is, no permanent address, no credit cards, no Social Security number, etc. Question -- how does he get paid royalties? For the publisher to pay him, they are going to want to deduct that expense on their taxes. To do that they have to have a Social Security number, a corporate ID, or possible make the payment to a foreign national in their own country. It's still good hype to have the author remain quite mysterious - no interviews, no book tour, no e-mail. He communicates only through his agent via scrambled-signal satellite telephone. How is the satellite phone account paid for?  <br /> <br />Anyway, the story. This book, the first of a trilogy, sets up a fight between the forces of light and darkness that is happening behind the scenes, off the grid if you wish.  <br /> <br />The bad guys are the Tabula. They're sort of like the Patriot Act run amok.  <br /> <br />The good guys are the Harlequins - no they don't write romance novels. They run around with swords in what I envision as  a 'Kill Bill' environment and fight the Tabula.  <br /> <br />Inbetween are the Travelers who have an ability to project their spirit into other worlds where they can receive wisdom to bring back to earth.	2005-10-14

This is where it all began, one small book, supposedly marketed at pre-teens, released to an uncertain reception, not yet the worldwide hit it was destined to become. What worthy person can possibly be immune to the charm here? An orphan who is secretly heir to great powers, fame, fortune, escape into another, more interesting world... There are universal themes here, of course, heroism, villainy, mystery, a quest, a hidden inheritance, clandestine passages within a great foreboding castle, but there is also much that is new. J.K. Rowling's creation is so inventive and fun it's no wonder it's brought as much joy into the world as it has. I unapologetically love this book even though I'm twice the age of its supposed target audience, and I've read and re-read it since I first got it several years ago. I think Harry Potter, his friends, enemies, and their world are extraordinarily special, and I hope they entrance the minds and warm the hearts of readers for generations yet to come.	2005-10-14

Appalling yet thankfully equally forgetable! <br />Written from the perspective of two teenage girls, this book is suited to the same audience.  The writing though seemingly well-researched (as far as the cast of characters is concerned) is simplistic and insulting to an adult reader with more than a 6th grade education.  Her theory on the mystery is contrary to most published accounts and so offers a fresh perspective, yet it is an improbable and honey-coated approach to a great mystery and likely terrible crime.  Her lead character Nell's freedom of movement and accessiblilty through all barriers, borders and boundaries is absurd.  Not worth the price - not worth the time - not worth using it as a fire starter.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!	2005-10-14

Sara talks to Dulcie a lot through emails but doesn't feel; as close to her as she use to be, so Sara tries to tell Dulcie that Jon's friends are acting fake and they don't want to be her friends.  Jon's parents are wealthy and expect the best of him but they cant always get what they want.  Jon and Dulcie get really close sand he tells her he loves her.  After a while they get really close and end up getting physical with one another.  This wasn't the smartest idea of the two because Jon's parents don't like Dulcie and don't want them to be together.  A couple of days after their contact with one another Dulcie ended up being pregnant.  Dulcie tells Jon and Jon tells his parents, and they throw him out of the house.  Well Sara thinks they should get an abortion but Dulcie and Jon want to have it.  Dulcie and Jon end up out on their own. Read the book and you will know the ending.

As is becoming a trend in Salvatore books from an author that simply can't let go of a character Artemis Entreri, the same Artemis Entreri that was supposed to have died...twice...    Despite it's miscomings later on, the book actually begins rather well: Bruenor is crushed at the loss of Wulfgar, Drizzt is concerned about the Dark Elves intentions, and Catti Brie is still trying to figure out what to do with herself since she thought she was already going to be married by this book.     The book can be essentially broken down into two main plots: Drizzt/Catti Brie in Mithril Hall and Drizzt/Catti Brie/Artemis Entreri in Menzoberranzan. The first plot is strong and really builds on the characters. The second is simply a series of challenges for the trio which increase in intensity with the climactic moment being so over the top as to really catapult all 3 of these characters into the realm of fantasy Superheroes: they are invincible and unscated in the face of overwhelming odds.    Drizzt's ruminations as he decides to make the trip to his former homeland are where Salvatore is really able to bring about the overconfidence of his main character, an overconfidence which is built on well throughout this book. Drizzt's eventual capture and torture were fantastic opportunities for Salvatore to begin to show the real inner strength and, finally, limitations of Drizzt. Instead, this is where the book begins to slide down into the realm of superhero comicbook farce.     From the rescue of Drizzt by Artemis and Catti Brie to the Epilogue the trio faces simply impossible odds and still manages to escape the jaws of Menzoberranzan without a single scrape and quite a bit of loot to boot. With the whirling scimitars of Drizzt, the whirling knives of Artemis, and the unlimited ammo, ballista shotgun that is the bow of Cattie Brie (oh ya, she also now has a sword that can cut through stone and probably solid steel too): the trio are simply invincible.    I can't really place it, but I've lost some respect for these books after reading this one. I know going in what to expect: a relatively light read with some dramatic moments. I know that the main characters are all going to come back at some point because Salvatore just can't let them go. Despite this, I feel this story really is missing something. Perhaps it borders on being too fantastical, perhaps it's the overly dramatic moments which really don't come across well, or maybe it's just that the fight scenes in the previous two series just seemed a lot more gritty.     What I think it basically boils down to is there's only so many times where you can see characters go through hell and come back out before it loses it's novelty.	2005-10-14

Yes, I passed the test but not with the score I thought I would receive.  I ended up with a disappointed 794.  I read this book as well as the Exam Cram book thoroughly.  In addition, I have four year experience as a PC technician.  One might then inquire as to why the low score.  The answer is this:  the 70-270 test does not solely test your knowledge on Windows XP alone, as it should since there are separate tests for server, network management, active directory, etc.  You must have experience with Windows 2000/2003 server and Active Directory to get anything above an 850.  You will need to have an understanding of Group Policy (which is a server topic), Login Scripts (also a server topic) and Active Directory (which is a separate test itself).  Fortunately, I was able to get through it from the minimal experience I received from setting up a practice LAN with 2003 server with Active Directory installed.  However, I did not think that I would be tested on Windows Server or Active Directory, therefore, didn't study them.  If one were just to study this book as well as Exam Cram with no experience with 2000/2003 server, they would surely fail the test.  However, if you want to have a descent insight into XP Professional, this is a great book.	2005-10-14

Although I concur with some of the criticism from some of my fellow reviewers below, and would not claim that its merit lay in either great writing or a fascinating plot, I found it reasonably balanced, thoughtful and stirring. The tale of modern day Afghanistan is not a pretty one, but it is one we need to hear. It is especially poignant when you consider the shift that has taken place there in so short a space of time. Hosseini deals with this aspect of his story effectively. In fact, I could translate the image of Afghanistan's awful political situation to the world stage: we are probably closer to our own Afghanization than we might like to think. <br /> <br />However, the true reason for liking the book, for enjoying it with hardly a hitch all the way through, is for its characterization. The main characters are all highly stereotyped - Assef the bully, Baba the heroic male, Amir the coward - except for Hassan. Hassan is a very fine portrait of what I might call \\"a beautiful soul.\\" This is very hard to achieve - a portrait of a character who is somehow reaching out from within, attempting whether consciously or unconsciously, to touch those around him and be at peace with the world, just as he finds it. If my hunch is right, Hosseini deliberately made the other characters stereotypical in order to highlight this one character. I think he has succeeded and it is very fine writing. There are also other levels working along with the more obvious main story. Who and what is the kite-runner? Is he not an evolving character with his own personality which develops throughout the book. What was Baba's point in going against established thinking and befriending an Hazara family, and \\"pissing on the beards\\" of the mullahs and so on? What was the point of describing Soroya's incursion into pre-marital sex? All of these and many other details seem to combine so that we are always, like the main character in the book, being forced to askquestions. And as in all good writing, the questions we have to answer are not about the book, but about ourselves.	2005-10-14

Books	5	0	0	N	N	Great Review from Instinct Magazine	Instinct Magazine (October 2005) - Page 32 - Michael Williams <br /> <br />Sit back, grab a book and pour yourself a drink.  Well, maybe not that last part.  The Adventures of Soberman! is a tall glass of laugh-out-loud misadventures about the author's battle with alcoholism and everything else.  The author cleverly recounts his life experiences growing up Irish-Catholic in Hell's Kitchen, going to war in Vietnam, being married, realizing he is gay and discovering Alcoholics Anonymous-all while peppering his memories with hilarious and often touching anecdotes.  Soberman! just might leave you with a thought hangover.         <br />	2005-10-14

When sports figures write books on leadership, they often take the easy route - athletic metaphors, game time war stories, tenuous applications of sports experiences to business. This refreshing book breaks through such superficial ideas as decisively as a dunk by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in his prime. Ten-time national champion UCLA basketball coach John Wooden - generally considered the greatest college basketball coach to ever hold a clipboard - delivers a leadership book that stands alone at center court. Remarkably, none of Wooden's players recall him urging them to win. Instead, he urged them to do their best every moment. Take care of the process, he says, and the result will take care of itself. To Wooden, preparation is pivotal and every detail matters. Despite his almost obsessive focus on getting the little things right, Wooden believes in balance and consistency. He avoids extremes. Wooden's long-time collaborator and co-author Steve Jamison does a wonderful job of portraying, through the coach, a range of qualities, philosophies and characteristics that apply to every field. We strongly recommend this book to managers and executives who want to know how to lead people to victory in every game.	2005-10-14

First, it speaks in generalities to the rise of the Profession of Arms and talks about the development of professional officers. The second major theme is that it dicusses command and control and the execution and management of violence. the thesis is that decision making, technology and professionalism are essential tools that now become part of the overall thought, deliberate strategy planning and development process of the military. Thirdly, it speaks to and explores tactical decisiveness and lastly, it speaks to international law and custom.<br /><br />All in all this is a great book, but dont expect that the conclusions or answers to these themes will always jump out at you. You will need to read with intention to discern these 4 themes, and some others, and how they may or may not apply to your contemporary comparisons of Modern war, that is from roughly WW II to the Gulf War of 90-91 and Post-Modern War, that is, current warfare post 9-11.<br /><br />This two hundred year work of analysis ends where it begins. With the analysis of a decisive battle. The last 8 pages sum up a few of the auhtors conclusions; one that comes to mind is the political-military-business training and role that officers must have in order to perform there military roles effectively.<br /><br />The greatest benefit of this book will be derived when one compares post modern war with the tactical lessons of the battlefield.<br /><br />The academic debate rages, and will continue to rage over whether or not there is such a thing as the decisive battle. You will need to discern for yourself if the principles of war have changed and if the tactical execution of the battle has a direct correlation to the operational, strategic and or political aspects of war.<br /><br />ps. read this book slowly and with intention, there is much to absorb here.<br /><br />Terry Tucker, Prof Military Studies/History<br /><br />Senior Doctrine Developer SANGMP	2005-10-14

Todd Boden's evil is nurtured...whether it is by the Nazi he extorts into revealing his secrets, or by himself is worth debating.  The story is a study of abject evil and how it manifests in our world.<br /><br />This is a great book.  Stephen King is a fabulous writer who can really tell a story, and this is a good story to tell.  It's dark but (unfortunately) not supernatural at all.  It's not particulary gory but very scary.  Most of us know that the scariest stories are the ones that are plausible.  Unfortunately, this story is not only plausible but unfolding today in our society.  In that regard King is prescient since this book was written before modern schoolyard massacres.	2005-10-14

Llywelyn is great at writing historical novels and she even includes a short bibliography at the end.<br /><br />This book is about the adventures of a young druid named Anviar, we see him bloom from childhood into man hood and eventually into a wise coulcilor.  She ties this in with the hisrotical story of Vercingtrix and the struggle between Ancient Gual and Rome.  She doesnt give much explanation of Ceasor and the Romans, they are the bad guys and that is all the reader is given.  Llywelyn knows much about Ancient Celtic lore and proves it in this novel, she doesnt depict the Druids as the usualy mythological creatures that only work great magic and travel the lands looking to raise the next hero, she shows their humanistic side; Ainviars jealousy of Rix, Anviars inablility to bring all the people he wants back from the dead.	2005-10-14

He made a name for himself as the country was being formed, especially with his defense of \\"the rules of law\\" against the will of the majority. He was one of the last of the old Federalists. He was a foreign minister to Holland, Portugal, and Prussia, and was Secretary of State under Monroe (where he was the main force in establishing the Monroe Doctrine). He became the sixth President in a controversial election that was decided in the House of Representatives.<br /><br />Parson's short (272 pages) but thorough and well-written biography of Adams is a job well done. She details the accomplishments of his life, but focuses primarily on the man himself. Adams was a stern man (his portrait reminds me of some evil Dickens character, Marley perhaps), and not well-liked by the public. He believed that one should not \\"run\\" for a political office, but should just accept it if offered (imagine that today!). He hated Andrew Jackson and slavery, and fought hard against both. This is an excellent book on an interesting man.	2005-10-14

Pound for pound, this may be the best book on, about, or for aspiring writers.   <br /> <br />I have read at least 10 books on the craft of writing and a bunch on theory and technique... this book is right up there with the best of the best.  If you couple this book with Raymond Carver's posthumous \\"Call if You Need Me\\" and mix in a few careful readings of any Richard Yates interview, you've got yourself some tough rope to tow.  But if you want to be a strong writer, suck it up and do it anyway! <br /> <br />I hold a BA in fiction writing.  I also tend to write literary realist fiction.  If you are of the same mind, this book will help you tremendously.  It is brutal in it's explanation of what to steer clear of and what to include, but that is how it should be.  If you take writing very seriously, and want to take it to the next level, this book is a great start. <br /> <br />You can't go wrong when you have advice from C. Michael Curtis (Fiction Editor of the most prominent publication in America) and Frank Conroy (Chairman to the most prestegious writing institute in America.)  Pay attention folks.  This is the real deal.  Add in some very helpful workshop activites from one Tom Bailey (only a head writing professor at Harvard) and some very heartfelt tips from a true master like Dubus... Forget about it! <br /> <br />\\"On becoming a Novelist\\" was good.  \\"ABCs of Reading\\" was good.  \\"The Lonely Voice\\" was decent.

Not only is this book useful for songwriters but for worship leaders and ministry musicians as well.<br /><br />Baloche and the Owens' navigate the theory and mechanics of song composition without being too lofty for beginners or too condescending for veterans.  Songwriters and worship leaders should get this book for its clinical value alone.<br /><br />Of special interest to writers of worship songs is the authors' perspective that it is more difficult to write a good congregational song than a good artist song-the implication being that most of us assume the opposite.  They call attention to the struggle, and necessary self-denial a songwriter experiences when trying to create truly great melodies with  fresh, imaginative lyrics that can all be readily owned by common, untrained singers.  It was both freeing and compelling to read through their thoughts on that.<br /><br />The book also examines the role that music plays in leading and expressing the emotions, and how valuable that is in completing the worship experience of the Church.  As a worship leader and songwriter I was refreshed and inspired by the authors' plea on behalf of the Church, \\"Please, help us feel something!\\"	2005-10-14

We can see in your book how his days and nights in the cottage helped Lincoln to  hold on to and expand what he had until victory in the 1864 election was assured. <br /> <br />The other is the loving relationship of the President with his wife, Mary Lincoln. We often hear of her oddities and running up of debts. What we do not hear of, and what admirably is stressed in your book, is what you describe as \\"the mutual affection and mutual dependence\\" that always linked them despite their great differences in character.  Respect for Mary Lincoln, and her contributions to the greatness of Abraham Lincoln, is something we could use more of in writing American history. <br /> <br />I will not go on expect to say that I think I have already indicated the greatness of your book, and my hope that librarians and readers everywhere will have an opportunity to benefit from its revelations and the new light it brings on the life of one of our very greatest Presidents. <br />	2005-10-14

US	42946641	R1MX666U5VTX26	0806121432	328346478	In Search of Butch Cassidy	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A compelling story and a must read for those interested in the old west	I approached this book with a great deal of skepticism suspecting that it was probably another hoax and that William T. Phillips would most likely turn out to be just another J. Frank Dalton.  But Phillips' story is a little different.  After all, he never claimed to be Butch Cassidy, others simply claimed it for him and then only after he was dead and gone.  So I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br />Not only did the author present some rather convincing evidence that Phillips was indeed Robert LeRoy Parker, alias George \\"Butch\\" Cassidy, but the book also turned out to be the most informative book which I have read on the inner workings of a true western outlaw gang.  If one is not convinced that Phillips was Cassidy, one must surely conclude that he was at least a member of Cassidy's \\"Wild Bunch.\\" <br /> <br />The most compelling evidence, in my view, is the following: 1) the opal ring which Phillips sent to Butch Cassidy's Wyoming sweetheart, Mary Boyd, shortly before his death (inscribed on the inside \\"Geo C to Mary B\\"); 2) Phillips' Colt Peacemaker with Butch Cassidy's brand carved in the handle, 3) the affirmative handwriting analysis comparing a letter known to have been written by Butch Cassidy with a later letter written by Phillips; and finally 4) Phillips' intimate knowledge of Butch Cassidy, his associates and the people he knew or worked with, the areas in which he lived and rode, and the robberies which he planned and carried out; all as  expressed in his unpublished [autobiography?] \\"The Bandit Invincible, the Story of Butch Cassidy.\\" <br /> <br />The most interesting thing to me about this book, however, is not whether or not William Phillips was, in fact, Butch Cassidy, it was the detailed descriptions of how Cassidy would plan and carry out his raids. I was also struck by the intimate details concerning the cattle wars in Wyoming and life as it really might have been in the old west.  I only wish that Phillips hadn't used a fictitious name for theSundance Kid in \\"Bandit Invincible\\" which was written in 1930.  If, as he said, he changed the names of living persons so as not to incriminate them, one can only wonder why he changed Harry Longabaugh's name in his book and yet described the manner in which he died.  That is a real puzzler. <br /> <br />The only thing I didn't like about this book was the way in which it skipped back and forth between Phillips' writings and information from the author's other sources, at the same time introducing lots of new people and information.  This seemed to confuse the issue and break the continuity (ergo, 5 to 4 stars).  All things considered, though, this is a truly remarkable story and a must read for anyone interested in the old west and its history. <br />	2005-10-14

It's also a must-read for those seeking the <br />perspective of young men and women who volunteer for the armed <br />forces knowing they will go abroad to fight for the <br />freedom of others.   <br />  <br />If you've read Elisha Hunt Rhodes' Civil War journal, <br />Tom Brokaw's \\"The Greatest Generation\\", or Stephen <br />Ambrose's \\"Citizen Soldiers\\", then you should add this <br />World War I memoir to your collection of perspectives <br />of foot soldiers who lived and breathed war day in <br />and day out.  Grand histories of battles and wars are <br />one thing, but reading such close-in, first-hand <br />accounts helps us to understand how war and death and <br />occupation effect the thousands of \\"little people\\" <br />involved in the process.   <br /> <br />When you read how the book was written (over a decade <br />after the end of the war, using his notes and <br />postcards), you'll appreciate that the level of detail <br />that McQuain remembered was the direct result of what <br />a searing experience the trauma of war was for him.  <br />As is the case with many soldiers years and even <br />decades after the fact, McQuain was able to remember <br />the minutest detail with only a small reminder of the <br />facts.  McQuain's daughter explains the process, and <br />(as Ken Burns did so well in the case of Elisha Hunt <br />Rhodes and others in \\"The Civil War\\" documentary) <br />tells the reader briefly about the rest of her <br />father's life and a bit about the family he raised.   <br /> <br />The view of McQuain's life after the war is the one <br />known all too well by families of veterans.  But too <br />often vets are reluctant to share with their families <br />the horrors they experienced abroad.  \\"To the Front <br />and Back\\" will give the reader a new perspective on <br />that grandfather who wouldn't talk about his <br />experiences in World War I or World War II, or on <br />what's currently being experienced by a son, daughter, <br />husband, or wife who is currently in Iraq or <br />Afghanistan.   <br />	2005-10-13

Nietzsche was raised by his mother, grandmother and aunts; later in his life, his sister would become executor of his estate (after Nietzsche had become incapable of managing his own affairs) and reshape his philosophy and writings in her own idea - this becomes a running motif in later anthologies of Nietzsche; editors can quote and clip to fit their own agendas. In some ways, that is true of the text here, but in much less inappropriate ways than others, particularly Nietzsche's first editor, his sister.<br /><br />Nietzsche was a star pupil from his earliest days at university in Bonn and Leipzig. His formal study was in classical philology, but his attentions turned in various directions quickly during his writing and professional life - he had an intense interest in drama and the arts, with Wagner's music and Greek drama in principal interest. His first book was devoted to these topics - 'The Birth of Tragedy'. It was not highly regarded at the time, but has since become much more appreciated as an anticipation of later developments in philosophy and aesthetics.<br /><br />Nietzsche's life after this period was a very choppy one - he left the university, claiming illness, and while this developed later to be a true situation, at the time is was probably academic politics and difficulties fitting in with the establishment he was trying to break. He had a formal falling-out with Wagner, even writing later a piece entitled ' Nietzsche contra Wagner', finished just a few week prior to his going insane.<br /><br />In another edition, Walter Kaufmann states that Nietzsche's real career took off after his active life was over; under his sister's direction, many of the writings Nietzsche had managed to do and not get published, or which were published but forgotten, really took off in major directions. While his major works of Zarathustra, Ecce Homo, Will to Power and Genealogy of Morals were in various editions of disrepair (indeed, the Will to Power was never more complete than a series of notes), Nietzsche had a knack for language that made him very quotable, and his influence continued to grow well into the first half of the twentieth century, influencing art, philosophy, history, and politics in dramatic ways, if not always the ways in which Nietzsche envisioned.<br /><br />For example, Nietzsche was not particularly impressed with the 'typical' German anti-semitism, which later erupted into the Nazi movement. He considered it rather bourgeois, and while he undoubted had his own issues with Jews (Nietzsche had issues with almost everyone, particularly any group, Christians included, who had a religious connection), the Nazi use of Nietzsche's work owes more to Nietzsche's sister's influence than anyone else.<br /><br />'The Genealogy of Morals' is perhaps the closest in form to English-speaking philosophical discourse. This is a discussion that involves philosophy, psychology and linguistic theory, looking at morality in three different essays. The first essay explores the idea of good and evil as good and bad; Nietzsche develops the idea of master and slave morality - the slave resists the ideas of the master, and thus values things that are less likely to gain power - Nietzsche sees Christianity as an example of slave morality.<br /><br />The second essay looks at the issues of conscience and guilt, and how these spawned the invention of gods. The third essay concludes the work with a look at ascetic ideas, how these relate to aesthetic ideas, and where in Nietzsche's opinion the great philosophers of the past have gone wrong.<br /><br />In his book Ecce Homo (first published posthumously), Nietzsche analyses his own workpiece by piece, as well as gives an overall assessment of his life. Nietzsche's insights into his own writings in hindsight is fascinating to behold. His own idea of 'The Genealogy of Morals' can be found in this piece as follows:<br /><br />'Regarding expression, intention, and the art of suprise, the three inquiries which constitute this Genealogy are perhaps uncannier than anything else written so far. Dionysus is, as is known, also the god of darkness.'<br /><br />Nietzsce is not easy reading, and this work is not the best for casual reading or the first-time reader of Nietzsche. However, for those who have already made some headway into understanding him, this is a good volume.e analyses his own work piece by piece, as well as gives an overall assessment of his life.

A little sarcastic and anti-social maybe, but I connected with her instantly.  <br /> <br />It's a book that, while being mature, isn't drenched in the usual sex and blood that makes a good vampire book so hard to find. It's a romance, but it's nowhere near sweet. It's not overly wordy, either - you know what's going on.  <br /> <br />Edward is a great character to, and his family is especially endearing - particularly Alice. Meyer's imagination on what vampires would actually be like is really cool. No turning to stone in the sun, folks!  <br /> <br />All in all, I could not put this down. If you're a teen looking for a good read, this is it. If you're an adult in need of a good vampire book or a good romance, it'll satisfy you, to. <br /> <br />One of my favorites, instantly.

It's another great story with wonderful characters we've come to know and love.   <br /> <br />I re-read the earlier books just before Snow & Ashes was published, and must admit that the series struck me a little bit like an old movie serial--with perilous situation after perilous situation.  And read back-to-back like that, it got a tad tedious, though I was pleased that in this book neither Claire nor Jamie were in mortal peril until after page 200.  On the whole, though, I found it a good mix of the exciting and the mundane.  (Unlike some reviewers in this forum, I very much like the depiction of details of their everyday life, and the ways Claire brings a little 20th-century medicine to 18th-century North Carolina.) <br /> <br />I don't quite understand the cries of \\"Cliffhanger. Aaagghh!\\" I've seen here.  I thought the ending was very straight-forward with no major questions left unanswered (except, perhaps, how Roger and Brianna afford their new real estate).  Perhaps I am taking things too much at face value, but I thought many more old questions were answered than new ones asked. <br /> <br />There were some quibbles with the book--I found Jocasta's behavior revealed at the end rather unbelievable, for example--but on the whole I thought it was a great volume.  I, too, enjoyed seeing old friends like Ian and Lord John, and watching Claire and Jamie's relationship mature and develop.  I can't imagine any fan of the series being disappointed in this book.	2005-10-13

Giangregorio, Mikko Hrmeinen and Keith Bonn; and, Weapons Tables by Hugh Foster and Keith Bonn.   <br />As Glantz points out in the introduction, the four year struggle ranged over 600,000 square miles and killed tens of millions of soldiers and civilians. He contends that the very size of the Eastern Front War makes it difficult to comprehend it in detail and therefore to place it in context of the Russian contribution to overall victory and this is why this book is such a valuable addition to the literature on the war.  Slaughterhouse places a great deal of information and succinct analysis in the reader's hands. <br />There is a wealth of data in this book, much of it technical.  Organizational tables show the composition of units down to brigade in some cases.  The Orders of Battle list all units from Army Group or Front down to division, along with date of activation, campaign history and successive commanders. As page after page rolls by in this section, 247 pages in fact, the reader can appreciate the massive scale of the conflict in the east. Every weapon used in the theater is listed in comparative tables which are comprehensive and easy to understand. Tanks, tank destroyers, all forms of small arms, all forms of artillery, assault guns, plus aircraft, including lend-lease air planes, appear side by side. Calibre, weight, rate of fire, range, crew, armor thickness, combat radius, speed, it is all here and as is typical of this well-researched book, many photographs of the weapons as well.  <br />Especially useful is the annotated chronology with well-placed maps which, in forty-five pages, provides the reader with an overview of the campaigns. Glantz sees the Battle of  Stalingrad as the decisive turning point of the war.  With regard to relative contributions to victory, Glantz's use of statistics demonstrates that even after the Normandy landings over sixty per cent of the German Army was still in the East and over sixty per cent of its losses as well.  <br />Glantz discusses also the role of Lend-Lease to the Soviets in the Allied victory. He determines that of the matriel the West delivered to the Soviet Union, vehicles, particularly trucks (55% of all used and 42% of jeeps), locomotives and rail cars, contributed most by logistically aiding Red Army offensives. If the Soviets had not received this assistance, he adjudges, it would have taken them 12 to 18 months longer to defeat the Germans.   <br />In the last chapter, Forgotten Battles, Glantz identifies several neglected operations which deserve research.  Here Glantz returns to one of his themes, namely that in order for a proper understanding of the war in the east, more must be known about the numerous counteractions the Red Army undertook during German offensives.  This is particularly so at the strategic level where the main question for Glantz is, to what extent did Stavka co-ordinate them and if so, what did the counteractions contribute to subsequent Soviet failures or successes.  <br />I found the biographical sketches of the senior officers very helpful and informative, especially the thirty-four Soviet portraits of commanders who are little known to the western reader or the Oxford Companion to World War II which has only 14. The book has a large select bibliography, a listof the finding aids for the captured German military documents at the National Archives, and a list of reliable websites.   <br />There is no better way to immerse oneself in the biggest and deadliest front of the war and to come away with informed insight than to read this book. <br />	2005-10-13

The only prerequisites are a very good understanding of set-theory and some knowledge of the theory of continuous functions (at the level of a first course in real analysis, e.g. Apostol's Mathematical Analysis). The development is patient and there is sufficient help for the beginner (full solutions at the back, and, for practice, unproved propositions in the text with proofs at chapter-ends). The coverage is not overwhelming and anyone with the requisite preparation can digest the book in a term's work. Measure theory on its own is an incredibly dry subject. The authors do a great job of covering the essentials in about 300 pages, while making the subject interesting and applicable at the same time. A very attractive feature of the book is its brief focus on mathematical-finance applications. Most chapters end with a small section on such applications which is very useful for someone simultaneously studying mathematical finance. Particularly, it shows how to conceptualize financial models measure-theoretically. A very useful little volume indeed!	2005-10-13

Her life is overflowing with one thing after another.  She is a greeting card artist, is working on owning her own Greeting Card store, is dealing with a group of off kilter frinds (very, loyal friends), a brother in a mental hospital and an uncle who maybe should be.  Throw into this that she is part of a dating project in which she has to date 40 men in 60 days.  She has plenty to do. <br /> <br />While on a late night visit to the mental hospital to take her brother aluminum foil (read the book to find out why :)), she first sees a dead body on the way to the hospital lying in the road.  Since she fears that her brother has knowledge of it, or may have something to do with it, she takes no immediate action.  While at the hospital, she is taken somewhat hostage by a man pretending to be a doctor who is actually running from the mob, and has some knowledge of why the guy is dead in the road.   <br /> <br />What follows is a completely amusing and engrossing tale of how this all works out in a really fresh new way of doing so.  I found certain elements just a little far fetched (can't tell you what they are without giving something important away), I still found it a very good read and am currently reading the second in the series. <br /> <br />I found Wollie to be a fun herione with a lot of very real elements about her.  You can't help but like her and look forward to what she might do next.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.  I did recognize that the author was an actress and do know who she is.  I don't see why some have made that an issue.  I think her work as an author and as an actress stand alone and speak for themselves.  I recommend her both as an author and an actress.	2005-10-13

I have to say that this is an incredibly disappointing book. One would expect by the title that some form of rationale would be presented for supporting the title's claim but the author fails to provide any such thing. Instead, she squanders a wonderful opportunity by abusing the medium to vilify dispensationalists and dispensationalism and her disdain for such fills nearly the whole book like shrapnel from a hand grenade. She also notes an author who \\"points of the danger of anti-Semitism in dispensationalism.\\" This is absolute rubbish. While I have only been familiar with dispensationalism for a few years I have yet to notice anything resembling the like in any of their writings. One thing the author absolutely should not have done is equate the apocalyptic vision in Revelation with the \\"apocalyptic\\" story of Dickens's \\"A Christmas Carol.\\" She goes to great lengths to try and establish a connection between the two but she never really succeeds. The author also has the temerity to suggest that the plagues in Revelation may be punishment for the social ills and injustice that have been committed. There is absolutely nothing whatsoever to support this fantasy. Near the end of the book we are finally led to know just why she published this book. The book of Revelation presents a sequence of events put in motion by God to right all of the social ills and injustice in the world. We find that she interprets Revelation according to her own populist theology. God is avenging the downtrodden. It is this reviewer's hope that because of this reinterpretation this book will receive a very short shelf life.	2005-10-13

It is basically an unknown story, since what they teach us in school is almost all of it lies and myths, for example that Queen Elizabeth sold her jewells to finance the first trip, or that everybody in Columbus' time believed the Earth was flat. By any standard, Columbus was a bit of a lunatic who probably also suffered from what todat we call bipolar disease (for example, he thought that God spoke to him directly). He seems to have been given to theatricality and emotional blackmail, but undoubtedly he was also very intelligent and a great navigator. He also had an urge for social climbing, and he longed for glory and fame more than for money. He was obsessed with finding a way to China, India and Japan by sailing West, which suited the Western European powers's commercial interests. As said before, in his time the great debate among learned people was not over the flatness or roundness of the Earth, but about its size. Columbus, by grossly underestimating it, became convinced that the voyage to Asia was within reach. Had there been no American continent, he would have been murdered or starved to death. But he was also a very courageous and brave man, and so he made possible what seemed impossible. He was a very bad politician, and his emotional diseases made him quarrel with soon former friends, which of course marred his leadership abilities. His life, very well written by Fernandez-Armesto, is a glorious, tragic and incredible epic which reads like the best adventure novels.	2005-10-13

As a BIG fan of well-plotted spy/adventure yarns, I have been frantically searching for someone, ANYONE who could fill the HUGE shoes left by Robert Ludlum after his death.  Without a doubt, Ted Bell IS the man to do it.  However as a reviewer also mentioned, he is too unique in his own right to assume somone elses spot.  He has created his own place in the world adventure/fiction, and he has done it quickly and he has done it very well.<br /><br />Just a few minutes of reading any of Bell's 3 novels and you can sense he just writes differently than what you normally find in this particular genre.  There is almost a harmony to how the sentences flow.  All I can say is in this case, Different isn't just good, it's GREAT.<br /><br />With Pirate, we see Alexander Hawke on his most daring mission yet.  A crazed decendant of Napoleon has a plan to unite China and France together against virtually any and all nations in order to pull off a frightening scenario that includes the Middle East and the one thing they produce more of than almost any other place on earth: Oil.  At first I thought that nobody in France or China could be stupid enough to pull off such an insane stunt, but trust me as you read Pirate, you will be utterly shocked at not how realistic it all is, but just how downright PLAUSIBLE it is.  Shockingly realistic.<br /><br />Do yourself an immense favor and give Ted Bell a shot.  You will NOT be disappointed.  Yeah, I know I've heard that one before and it certainly SEEMS like an overused cliche, but in this particular case, I simply cannot endorse this guy enough.  But if I could also bend your eye for just a few moments longer, if you take my advice, begin with 'Hawke' and then move on to 'Assassin' before reading 'Pirate'.  NOT because you must read them in order, they are ALL excellent, but they simply get BETTER.  I cannot WAIT for Alex Hawke's next outing.  Yes, the book is THAT good.	2005-10-13

Sir Gawain was everything a knight should be considering the fact that he's not perfect due to the fact that he's human.  The animals depicted in the hunting scenes directly tie in with the storyline with Sir Gawain and the lady of the castle.  The deer represented that Sir Gawain tried to flee away from having to deal with the lady of the castle.  The wild boar represented difficulty since it was stated that the boar in the hunt had killed a man.  Finally, the fox represented the fact that Sir Gawain was planning to be sly and conceal the fact that the lady of the castle had given him her girdle.  The fact that he would lie to the lord of the castle, shows that he is truly human and that he would like to keep his own head when he has to go meet back up with the Green Knight the following day.  The hunt over three days represents a series of three tests which later comes to aid or hinder Sir Gawain in his quest to keep his oath as a knight and follow through with the guidelines of \\"the beheading game\\".  The girdle at the end that all the knights in King Arthur's court take to wearing symbolizes that they are human and that they are not perfect and that humility should be observed.	2005-10-13

No one would be foolish enough to categorically deny the possibility.  Nonetheless, we can say that if there is such a process, no one has a clue how it would work.  Further, it would go against all human experience, like postulating that a natural process might explain computers.\\"  \\"In the face of the massive evidence we do have for biochemical design, ignoring that evidence in the name of a phantom process would be to play the role of the detectives who ignore an elephant\\".<br /><br />Well this is just riddled with logical loops and holes.  First, who is he to say that no one has a clue how it would work?  He has already stated (pp 189-192) that Stuart Kauffman and others claim they have a clue, but he has already peremptorily dismissed them so now he is going to ignore them.  Second why does it go against all human experience?  We have ample human experience of coming to understand new natural processes and laws that have opened up whole new ways of understanding.  Theories of gravity, electromagnetic forces, atomic structure, DNA replication come immediately to mind.  So it is not at all beyond human experience to discover a new natural process with major explanatory power.  Third, what is illogical about postulating that a natural process explains computers?  Humans are natural systems, human culture is a natural system, and computers have arisen from that natural system.  Our computers are crude and undeveloped compared to the computational systems of the human brain or any organism's ability to derive and process information from its environment. Electronic computers are the result of natural processes which can occur when natural systems like human beings emerge from cellular structures.  Fourth, the conclusion of biochemical design is what is on trial when he suggests that an undiscovered natural process might be an alternative explanation for the \\"evidence\\" !  He can't then logically claim that the very same evidence rules out the undiscovered process!  This paragraph alone is enough to toss Behe onto the intellectual rubbish heap!<br /><br />Behe puts forth what I will accept as strong arguments that the theory of gradual mutation and natural selection is insufficient to explain biochemical processes and structures.  He then waves his hands, metaphorically speaking, in two chapters about intelligent design, using very poor logic.  He dismisses other people who agree with the limits of natural selection, using deprecatory tactics to deflect legitimate investigation into their work.  He mentions how Lynn Margulis was \\"initially patronized and ridiculed, [then] eventually won grudging acceptance - and then acclaim - for her idea that parts of the cell were once free-living organisms.  But, he points out, symbiosis, although important, cannot explain the origin of complex biochemical systems.  He then proceeds to himself patronize and ridicule Stuart Kauffman who does put forth a promising framework for the origin of complex biochemical systems.  First he directly equates Kauffman's proposals on biological systems with \\"complexity theory\\" itself, describes complexity theory as \\"a mathematical concept to describe the behavior of some computer programs\\", and makes it sound as if Kauffman himself is a computer jockey playing artificial life games rather than an Marshall scholar, MD, Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Biotech company founder, and recipient of numerous prestigious awards and fellowships.  Kauffman's resume ([...]) makes Behe look like a grad student.  Behe mixes up Kauffman's ideas with others less profound, picks out pieces out of context, and then states that \\"this aspect of complexity theory\\" requires pre-existing, already functioning systems.  Behe finishes his dismissal of one of the most interesting investigations into the origins of life with a patronizing concluding paragraph:<br /><br />\\"Complexity theory may yet make important contributions to mathematics, and it may still make modest contributions to biochemistry.  But it cannot explain the origin of the complex biochemical structures that undergird life.  It doesn't even try.\\"<br /><br />In the dynamics of polemic discourse, Behe has just \\"inoculated\\" the reader who has yet to read Kauffman against these ideas which directly challenge Behe's conclusions.  The Behe reader now may think they know something about Kauffman and his ideas and that they are unimportant instead of powerful.  Behe performs an even more egregious \\"inoculation\\" when he misquotes Daniel Dennett to make him sound like a nut-case rather than the profound rationalist and meticulous logician that he is.  Behe is a crusader for God, and he doesn't want you to open your mind to these \\"godless\\" intellectuals.<br /><br />Behe is then so bold as to declare, in his concluding chapter, that the cumulative efforts of cellular biological investigation clearly and unambiguously point to intelligent design.  He then mournfully suggests that the scientific community's failure to embrace and announce that conclusion stems from various cultural pressures.  He examines and dismisses what he claims are the main arguments against intelligent design, but he conveniently overlooks the most potent argument that is the real reason the scientific community has not accepted intelligent design:  it doesn't provide any useful knowledge.<br /><br />Intelligent Design is a way of giving up.  Behe doesn't say \\"Look, natural selection may be necessary but it isn't sufficient to explain things the way they are.  Let's open our minds to new ways of thinking.  Maybe there is a natural principle right under our noses that we have been blind to.\\".  That's what Kaufmann says, but Behe says no, don't bother to try to find a natural principle for these problems.  They are too complex to have arisen on their own.  God created them.  Even if all these systems existed \\"in the mind of God\\" before they came into creation, how did they come into creation?  What are God's physical methods?  Those are the \\"as-yet undiscovered natural processes\\" that Behe would dismiss.<br /><br />Therefore, what Behe is really trying to do is to convince us to keep our minds closed.

Nothing I've ever read had such a thick storyline or plot as The City of Ember. But, it has some dragging parts in the middle, like about the main character's grandmother losing something. The City of Ember is a very interesting book to read, and I suggest it to avid readers who are sick of the Harry Potter Series or sick of waiting for some book to come out. <br /> <br />I like the mystery in the City of Ember, and I can see a very clear message from the author. Usually, some books don't have a clear purpose or message from the author because it's like some fantasy book. But The City of Ember is rare in that way. <br /> <br />The City of Ember is a kind of alien to the other books, and that's what makes the suspense. The main characters are Lind Mayfleet and Doon Harrow, two friends who are exactly opposite of each other. They solve the mysterys of their city with clues everywhere with the lights flickering....... <br /> <br />To find out what happens to Lina and Doon, read this book. It is worthwhile to read The City of Ember!	2005-10-13

After getting to know her hard-working local sanitation workers and touring some nearby staging areas, Royte ran into trouble when asking to inspect the modern for-profit landfills. (NYC garbage often ends up in landfills in my ever-so-accepting state of Pennsylvania.) Landfills are now gigantic corporate operations where secrecy rules, as if they have something to hide from irate citizens or nosy government inspectors. I was disappointed that Royte gave up on the landfills so easily, because if she had stuck with her detective work, she could have written a powerhouse investigative report on this shifty business. Royte has better luck with following her recycled items, gaining much insight into the nature of recycling operations, from the questionable economics of citizen sorting efforts to whether or not recycling things really saves energy or raw materials. The answers to these questions will probably be more depressing than you expect.<br /><br />Royte's coverage of recycling turns out to be the most useful aspect of this book, and you may conclude that it's not all it's cracked up to be. That's because Royte shows that consumer and household waste actually makes up just a tiny percentage of what goes to landfills, and quaint small-scale efforts by individual citizens barely make a dent when large-scale commercial and industrial operations are given no reason to reduce their infinitely greater amounts of waste. Eventually, the book narrows down its arguments to the real benefits of reducing consumption and consumerism, because in theory we won&#8217;t have to worry about disposing of waste that is never created in the first place. (A New York City sanitation official provided the telling quote that I used as the title of this review.) Unfortunately, Royte jumps around among a great many smaller issues in refining this concept, which results in quick and spotty coverage of many important aspects of the garbage universe, while the reduce-reuse-recycle consensus is not backed up by any corroborated economics or authoritative philosophy. That gives this book a scattershot, unfocused, and inconclusive feel, though the basic information is certainly useful for those concerned about their own ecological footprint.

It's fresh, with practical approaches that I've been applying in many communication situations.  THEY'VE WORKED! Some books make 'persuasion' feel more like 'manipulation'.  This author shows how persuading someone can be the end result of a relationship built on trust and an authentic awareness and interest in the other person.  Most importantly, there are lots of clear tools to help practice what she suggests. <br /> <br />For example, I am more aware of my attention and have gotten much better at paying attention by applying her advice.  Again, it's not about manipulating, but about really listening.  Erickson writes \\"Giving someone else your attention is a way of treating them, and yourself, with real respect.  It can't be faked.\\"  And she tells you HOW to do this better. <br /> <br />Also, there's a great list of questions to help prepare for an important meeting or phone call.  My book naturally falls open to pages 96 and 97 because I refer to them so often.  They help me get the focus off of myself and onto what's important to the other person/people.  I feel so much more prepared and confident when I use these questions to guide my planning. <br /> <br />I could go on and on, but one other way Erickson's book has had an impact on my communication is the \\"levels of engagement\\" she describes when having a chance encounter.  She asks: Are you engaging to be polite (hearing but not listening) - Level 1.  Or, engaging to be right (I know what you're going to say, I might even finish your sentences) - Level 2.  Level 3: engaging selectively (I have a pretty good idea about how I want this chance meeting to turn out because I know what you do for a living and it relates to what I do -- there could be a good opportunity here).  Or, Level 4: engaging to learn. (I want to understand as much as possible about you in the time available and under the circumstances.  Let's enjoy this chance meeting.) She writes more about each level but they really helped me realize how I was treating these situations - at conferences, cocktail parties, airplane rides.  Engaging to learn has had a tremendous impact on relationships I've developed (and business opportunities that have resulted much more naturally, genuinely, and enjoyably). <br /> <br />It's an easy to read guide that will encourage you to connect in a more meaningful way with others and will give you practical ways to make your communication more effective. <br />	2005-10-13

While balanced perspectives are available to those proficient enough to wade through the stormy seas of coverage, much of the reporting obsesses on the drawbacks and any failed efforts of the US military and its allies.  <br /> It is a very good thing that such myriad media did not exist in 1776.  In David McCullough's engaging rendering of America's birth, he exposes the many setbacks, missteps, defeats, desertions, and poorly planned or executed campaigns that plagued the nascent nation's ragged army. Had CNN existed in those days, a colonial version of Judy Woodruff could regularly regale viewers with leading statements such as \\"more and more of General Washington's supporters are growing disillusioned with his poor management and indeciveness.\\"   An 18th century Al Franken could have gone on Air America (a.k.a. Err America) and maligned the American military for declaring war on a sovereign country that posed it no threat.  And an equally vacuous, previous incarnation of Arianna Huffington would have had reason to have elite loyalists malign Washington and company on a reality-blurring blog had such technology been around during the Revolution. <br /> McCullough does document the miscalculations America's inexperienced military committed as well as list the many triumphs of the established and potent British forces.  He expounds upon the doubts many of Washington's contemporaries privately and sometimes publicly expressed.  Before the sober judgment of history could objectively evaluate the transfiguring legacy of Washington's accomplishments, the uncertainty of the present did give jusifiable cause to those who questioned his wisdom and strategy.   The eventual success of the ragtag colonial army-despite massive desertions-and the enduring American experiment prove the mastery of Washington's prowess and show why his name has become synonymous with greatness. The Father of his Country would not have earned his rightful place in history had he failed to remain steadfast when the going got tough or adroitly recovered from the inevitable mistakes that befall all battlefield planning. <br /> \\"1776\\" fleshes out a timeless story and shows that there were many difficulties and heartaches that preceded the ultimate victory.  It also serves as a good inspiration for the ongoing liberation of Iraq.  Had the clichs of \\"quagmire\\" and \\"another Vietnam\\" existed in the 1700's no doubt the ancestors of today's antiwar ilk would have routinely invoked them.  As this readable work clearly spells out, war is a messy proposition where the best laid plans can and do go astray, but setbacks can never excuse retreat.  A far stronger case could have been made for abandoning the mission in 1776 than modern day Iraq.  Years from now both will stand as American military victories, and the bumps along the road to success will be reduced to historic footnotes.  <br />	2005-10-13

You will understand why.<br /><br />First published in 1924 this book is, perhaps, the precursor of Jeremy J. Siegel's book \\"Stocks for the Long Run : The Definitive Guide to Financial Market Returns and Long-Term Investment Strategies\\"<br /><br />Twelve tests were performed using different well-diversified common stock portfolios comparing them to bond portfolios. The main thesis is that bonds are less conservative than stocks. The metric chosen?  Returns after approximately 20 years.<br /><br />He considers basically 2 periods, one when dollar appreciates in real value (1866-1885) and one when dollar depreciates in real value (1901-1922). The results show that, considering capital gains and income from dividends, Commons Stocks ALWAYS beated bonds. The book is well written but some details are missing.<br /><br />But why this book is so special?  Stay tuned !<br /><br />Irving Fisher (October 15, 1929):<br />\\"Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau. I do not feel that there will soon, if ever, be a fifty or sixty point break below present levels, such as Mr. Babson has predicted. I expect to see the stock market a good deal higher than it is today within a few months\\"<br /><br />Who was Irving Fisher?<br />In one sentence: America's most respected and famous economist, renowned for developing a theory of money that explained the valuation of Financial Assets (from Steve Keen's book Debunking Economics.)<br /><br />Do you remember (from physics course) the Clapeyron's law PV=nRT ?<br /><br />Well, Irving Fisher was the author of a similar \\"law\\" for economics: MV=PT (money mass, velocity of money circulation, price level, number of transactions).<br /><br />Less than two weeks later: Black Monday (October 28, 1929).<br />DJIA closed 12.8% below previous level and fell another 11.7% the following day. Three years later stock indices had fallen 90%.<br /><br />Fisher lost over US$ 100 million in today's dollars and was reduced to penure. His wealthy sister-in-law helped him, saving him from complete bankruptcy, forgiving Fisher's loans in her will.

This is definitely not her usual style of writing, but this just proves that she is versatile and true to the gift of writing.  These ladies all have something in common & that is they have a discreptancy in their lives, but who would ever think that they will get what is due by a stranger?!  Tess, is skillful, beautiful and has pulled herself into a secret success story, only if Trace could understand her and what she has had to live with, but then you cannot convince someone to understand you, when they are so consumed with themselves and looking down at you. Now, Tess actually could have her own book, especially if you think about Vincent, he could be the perfect partner, in every aspect of her life, ooooooh that would be a great story line, a business partner and a personal partner, when a man is skillful personally and professionally and has the looks and body to make you loose your mind, umh whata man whata man, whata man!  Nikki, Nikki, street savvy, beautiful, skillful with her hands, has a skill that most women don't even dream of, making her a true asset in the world of Men, but too much of TRUST, shows to be life changing.  Kim, o Kim did he get his or did she get hers or did you get yours?? Kim is successful, beautiful and has a secret, and trying to keep it all in tact, shows to be disappointing, never thinking that Troy would do what he is doing, and then Stephanie reacts also, who do you run too....did you ever think about Malcolm?  Well, these ladies all have a secret that will bind them together, even though their worlds are so far apart.  Don't ever underestimate the power of women, when she has been weakened by a man, well let's see when a man thinks he has weakened her, cause it is not over until she gets hers.	2005-10-13

Mr. Badger's Birthday Pie contains many repetitive elements, such as \\"you run in front, I'll run behind\\" and \\"but the fox ran faster\\".  The pattern builds and builds until the greedy fox is tripped up by Great Uncle Ram.  The story is a good one for retelling but I have to say that even I am confused by the ending.  It's supposed to provide a satisfying conclusion, but it really doesn't make sense.  If there were two pies all along, why did Miss Poppy go to such extremes to chase the fox?  And, yes, it's a happy ending but a child that's too young will be surprised that they're all eating pie when we clearly saw it smashed... This book works best for 2-3 year olds.  Anyone older will get hung up on this mysterious second pie, not mentioned until the end.  Where was the other one set to cool?  She is described as making \\"the\\" pie and setting it to cool, not \\"a\\" pie.  So, I guess if you're picky (like me) you could use it in unit about indefinite and definite articles.      By the way, you can also use this book with older children to introduce recipes using plants we now consider weeds.  A good accompanying book, if you'd like to make your own homemade dandelion wine, is The Dandelion Celebration by Peter Gail.	2005-10-13

If your class uses this book, prepare to go to class. All the time. That's because if you fall behind, the book does not do a good job of explaining things to you. Examples are generally vague and only apply to a few types of problems provided at the back of each section. A lot of the time, I'd find myself stumped on a problem, looking back, and realizing there was no example problem for me to get ideas from. <br /> <br />Yes there are lots of problems and that's good, in a way. But what's the point of having all those problems if the book never teaches you how to do them? <br /> <br />Furthermore, it is a poorly written book. Generally, reading through the book is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Literally speaking. You spend all that time figuring out what the authors talk about and once you figure it out, it was not even worth all that time. <br /> <br />So go to class. All the time. If the prof isnt that great, get yourself another workbook. I havent seen Schaum's but I'm pretty sure they'll do a better job on covering the topics than this text does.	2005-10-13
US	49415047	R2K9LCSEKP4H9Q	1851681167	991379468	God, Chance and Necessity	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Accessibility gained at the expense of sophistication	Keith Ward's \\"God Chance and Necessity\\" is extremely accessible to the general reader, much like Richard Dawkins' book, \\"The Blind Watch Maker\\". I think he does the public a service by making it so easy to read. Unfortunately, this accessibility is largely gained at the expense of a certain philosophical elegance, if you will. For example, in some contexts he'll use the word \\"universe\\" as meaning physical spacetime, and in other contexts he'll use it to mean \\"everything that exists, including God.\\" Initially, he tells you when he's changing his meaning, but then he later doesn't.<br /><br />In short, if you are used to the clarity and rigorous approach used by many philosophical authors (e.g., Immanuel Kant, Aristotle, etc.), then you may find Ward's approach a bit less deductive (or even inductive). He is mostly concerned with rebutting Dawkins and Atkins than actually developing an original philosophy.<br /><br />For instance, he develops many interesting metaphysical ideas (for example, human free will is not incompatible with God's omniscience, since God could conceivably know of every *possible universe* while the future of the *actual universe* was indetermined), but he doesn't lay down a rigorous metaphysical system. I suppose one reason he does this is because he wants to appeal to a wide crowd of religious people who have their own doctrines, and they might feel alienated if Ward was to make truth claims beyond what is universally accepted about how the universe works.<br /><br />Not clearly a good thing, he often waxes lyrical in poetic tangents that don't do much to help his case, except maybe emotionally or aesthetically. Though, I suppose if intuition and aesthetics are any basis for concluding something about reality, then these tangents aren't entirely wasteful. Oh, and for some reason he frequently employs awkward transitional adverbs to begin sentences like, \\"In fact, of course, it is true that...,\\" which I found distracting.<br /><br />I think this book's greatest success is in highlighting the grave limitations of natural selection *alone* to explain intelligent life. He effectively proves that the idea of life existing for the propagation of genes (Cf. Dawkins, \\"The Selfish Gene\\") is completely ludicrous (it would be, he points out, lik^C
